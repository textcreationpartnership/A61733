            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our ſelfe, I conceiue, as well as others, both may and will, at firſt ſight, wonder more then a little at the title of this Dedicatory, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it, if not preſumtuous, at leaſt farr fetch'd, by a ſtranger, by an English man, by one wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, neyther in a capacity to deſerue well at your hands, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you by any ſeruice. All this notwithſtanding, I come with confidence to your feet to make my addreſs, and with ſoe much the greater, as the pre-alledgd cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb facs="tcp:50961:3"/> cleare mee of all ſelf-endedneſs in the caſe. And why should I not, ſynce I haue to doe with a Prince who is a cherisher of ingenuity, whoſe goodneſs promiſes an acceptance not onely beyond but euen without meritt. Therfore I come as full of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſimplicity as voyd of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, nor ſeek admittance but by my ſyncerity, which aymes at nothing beſydes gratitude and an humble acknowledgment. But how come I engag'd as to theſe? If I am not for my owne ſake, at leaſt for my friends: if not in my ſelfe, at leaſt in my Country: if not explicitly or perſonally, at leaſt implicitly but yett really.
<pb facs="tcp:50961:3"/> With a ſmall treſpaſs on your Highnes patience Ile tell you all.</p>
            <p>Euer ſynce you were pleaſd to grace England with your preſence, many Princely expreſſions of your value for our Nation are reported to haue falln from your mouth, as indexes of your affection, euen to a more then tacit preference of the ſame before others. I dare not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this ſo much to its meritts as your goodnes; but howeuer it were, it is both honorable to it, and obliging to vs: <hi>out of the abundance of the hart the tongue ſpeaks.</hi> Nor should we eaſily haue belieu'd reports had we not ſeen them vnder your hand and ſeale, and in ſuch tearmes as import
<pb facs="tcp:50961:4"/> euen a kind of paſſion both for the generall, and much more diuers particulars. Its inbred to Princes to Compaſſionate the afflicted; and with what a deep reſſentment were you pleaſd to expreſs your ſelfe to my Lady of G. ouer the Sufferings of Romane Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques euen ſo farr, as to profeſs <hi>ſo particular a kindnes for all thoſe of that Kingdome, that,</hi> ſay you, <hi>I could be Content to ſpill my blood to aſſiſt them, and contribute to theyr ſelicity in this world, ſynce theyr invincihle Conſtancy in Suffering perſecution usakes them meritt an eternall Crowne in the next.</hi> Theſe are your owne words and hugely ſignificant. The truth is the Cauſe of Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
<pb facs="tcp:50961:4"/> there is ſo clearly good, that no Prince of that beliefe can doubt of it, but he muſt together doubt of his owne fayth. Euery ſuch Prince ownes this truth, but not euery one with ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation: the proteſtation is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to you and encouraging to vs. Why may we not then, nay why ought we not Syr, in a due returne of Ciuility take notice of it, by Regiſtring it to the world, that ſo it may be at leaſt its owne Monument to poſterity if we can erect no other.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> this is one part of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment I am to make: the other is yett more Reall; as much as deeds are before words. You
<pb facs="tcp:50961:5"/> were pleaſd not onely to ſay much of English Catholiques but alſo to doe much for them: &amp; this was verifyd by that noble ſupply of charity wherwith you relieu'd a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsd Religious Community of that nation ready to ſink vnder the burden of its wants. If I could deem it fit to giue ſcope to my pen, here is a large field and ample ſubject wherin to dilate. But I dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſound the trumpett, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Scripture, to your almes deeds; charity louing to ſpeak rather by hynts and intimations then bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſting language on ſuch a theme. And therfore Modeſty bids me for beare to ſay much, as well as grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſomething, leaſt I may ſeem
<pb facs="tcp:50961:5"/> eyther to flatter, or to begg a new. The Charity indeed was as ſignall as vnexpected, and as vnexpected from ſuch a hand as if it had dropt downe from heauen, as ſurely it did; a meer piece of prouidence, and a Maſter one of that great Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Family to his Religious Seruants. S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> I pretend not here to make a panegyrick of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; that requires a more refin'd pen: but yet neyther muſt wee shutt our eyes againſt the Shining Sun though it dazle them, but with reuerence decline the ſight. Yett I muſt not omitt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how well you plac'd your Charity: among all the little ones of our Lord who neerer or
<pb facs="tcp:50961:6"/> dearer to him then his Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſes, the nobleſt part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or his Myſticall body, as S. Cyprian ſtiles them, and leaſt able to help themſelues. Noble alſo euen as to the world, and this renders theyr caſe more Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate: for what greater object of Commiſeration then ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in a deep or neceſſitous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay; where shame retards, as much as want preſſes, from expoſing theyr Condition, when euery Common beggar can doe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blushing, and Conſequently not ſo much to be pitty'd.</p>
            <p>And hence, great Prince, ariſes another part of my Obligation and preſent engagement; a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:50961:6"/> tye of Spirituall intereſt linking mee and that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo into a Common vnity, that I cannot but deem its good and bad Concerns my owne, and be deeply Concernd in both. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by my preſent employment for ſome yeares has entitled mee to a reliefe of theyr Spirituall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſityes, as Charity and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did your Highnes to theyr temporall. In this Spirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt I cannot but be ſenſible of theyr temporall: and though the former alone be my Concern, yett I cannot but be Concernd for the latter, as the formers neceſſary ſupport, without which it cannot ſubſiſt: A ſpirituall tye as more
<pb facs="tcp:50961:7"/> partaking and neerer Relating to charity, is, or may be, equally if not more forcible to engage one then the temporall: and this is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground of my preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The firſt Addreſs I made as an English-man, and on the ſcore of my Nation; this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as a Religious, and for theyr ſake whome charity obliges me to wish as well as my ſelfe; and I know it will be gratefull to them that I acknowledg the fauour.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus farr giuen ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Addreſs, I muſt now apologize for the Preſent I make and that in more reſpects then one. The firſt is its ſlendernes, for which it may ſeem to reſemble the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb facs="tcp:50961:7"/> Mite in the Treaſury of ſo many rich Dedicatoryes as are and haue bin made to your Highnes. And I doe not mislike the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance; both becauſe tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſing its Worthleſnes, as alſo becauſe as that, this not withſtanding, found a gracious acceptance, ſo doe I hope through your Princely goodnes will this. That had nothing to Commend it but the Doners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; if myne be not as good as hart can make it, I can onely ſay I wish it ſo. S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> I pretend not to preſent you with a piece of curious <hi>VVitt,</hi> but a piece of home-bred <hi>Sanctity:</hi> and I hope I mistake not my meaſures;
<pb facs="tcp:50961:8"/> the former as from mee might ſuffer perchance its exceptions, as ſauouring a little of vanity: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is but what becomes my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Religious, and thats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond exception. And, I hope, I do not diſparage Sanctity by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it home bred; the Sanctity of our Iland hauing bin in former times not onely the ſtaple Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, as I may ſay, of the ſame, but of Chriſtendome; illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church of God with as many and noble lights in that Kind as perchance any of its neighbouring Kingdomes. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come vnder the shadow of ſanctity, as leaſt lyable to ſuffer in the eſteem of the good; it being
<pb facs="tcp:50961:8"/> wellcom to euery one that's good: Synce euen thoſe that are not Saints, yett loue and admyre them and theyr Sanctity. On this Score I confide it will not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable, eſpecially to your Highnes, ſo noted a Patron of the Vertuous as well as <hi>Virtuoſi:</hi> I confide alſo neyther the Saint nor I shall fare the worſe for being English. A Religious Preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems a Religious man, nor shall I be taxd on that behalfe; and as I come with a great deale of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, ſo I beg to be receiu'd with Cordiality, and I cannot fayle I know of my Requeſt. If I aymd at rarityes, they ought to be rare indeed if fitt for Princes
<pb facs="tcp:50961:9"/> Cabinetts; but ayming at Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the more ſimple it is, the more Commendable, a little of it is deemd pretious and goes farr, nor needs it any aſcititious foyles to ſett it off. Princes indeed are aboue rarityes, as cloyd with them; and it fares with ſuch, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently doth with Stomacks cloyd with dayntyes; they'l feed more ſauourly on a courſe dish then on the choyſeſt viands. And to this purpoſe I haue bin inform'd from no meane hand (and I Comfort my ſelfe not a little in it) that a ſleight Religious Preſent of a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Relique of an English Saint will find a gratious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in your benignity; and what
<pb facs="tcp:50961:9"/> elſe is it I here tender then a rough draught of a great Saint?</p>
            <p>Not ſome but many will more then probably wonder at the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor ſpare to cenſure mee for Dedicating an English Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to an Italian Prince: and thoſe alſo I muſt ſatisfy, not your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. To wit, euery one knowes not your aduance, I may ſay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the knowledg of the English tongue, nor has had the honour and fauour, like mee, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rvſe your letters, in that language, the natiuenes of the phraſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the expreſſion, beſydes the ſpeaking and vnderſtanding part, and all to ſuch a degree as few externs are wont to attaine.
<pb facs="tcp:50961:10"/> And what an eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Nation doth this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? or what greater argument of both, then the long patience in ouercoming all the difficultyes of ſuch a thorny vndertaking for ſo inconſiderable a purchaſe? This affection, this argument, this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, bidds me confide, you will S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> not onely haue patience with myne, but alſo that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomthing to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And ought we not, in ſuch a meane Competency as our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity affords, cherish ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in you, at leaſt giue a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our endeauour? vpon ſuch motiues as theſe, that which might ſeem a deterrment is to mee
<pb facs="tcp:50961:10"/> an encouragement, to wit, its Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying an English face and ſpeech, in a word its being English. It will not rellish worſe but better, I hope, to your pallat, eſpecially ſynce your naturall appetite and inclination lyes ſo much that way. Why shall not I hope that at ſpare houres it may proue a paſtime to diuert your ſelfe now and then by reading a Chapter of the ſame, greater perchance then if it had bin in your natiue language? at leaſt I feare no juſt exception on this behalfe.</p>
            <p>As to the ſubject of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I am ſure it is good in it ſelfe, howeuer I haue menaged it: to wit, a Saint and his life, who was
<pb facs="tcp:50961:11"/> ſuch all his life long, euen from his baptiſme till his death, neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyting, ſtill improuing the firſt grace and Sanctity, he receiu'd therin. This will appeare out of the Context of the Hiſtory by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory prooffs: as alſo a fayre Perſpectiue of ſuch Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as make and modell a Saint, and which well Copy'd out by imitation will make the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner a Saint too. Who though he were a Prelate yet he was a Prince alſo, as all Epiſcopall Prelates are, and may ſerue for a patterne euen to temporall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well as Eccleſiaſtick. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy indeed Conſummated his Sanctity, but I may ſay he
<pb facs="tcp:50961:11"/> was a Saint before he was a Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op; he adorning the Myter as much as the Myter him: and ſo noble by deſcent, that no Prince need think it any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement euen on that ſcore to propoſe him to his actions for a ſamplar of imitation. Of this great Saint I haue drawen a Picture on paper in black and white repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the lineaments and featu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of his vertues and Sanctity that I haue bin able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. For the ſyncerity, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and truth wherof I can onely ſay this, that all or the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts and proportions are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the authentique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of his Canonization, which
<pb facs="tcp:50961:12"/> are not to be queſtion'd. This homely black paper Picture, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, great Prince, vpon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant aboue mentiond, to preſent you with all: becauſe it is black it cannot blush at its owne rudenes; and though it be homely; I doubt not the fauour of your acceptance, not for its meritts but your innate goodnes, which rejects nothing thats good, as my intention at leaſt, I am ſure, is.</p>
            <p>But euen your Princely Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſet a ſyde, I come not altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at random and without clayme, nay I know not who can lay a better. S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> this great Saint dy'd in your Dominions neer Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and his Sacred Corps were
<pb facs="tcp:50961:12"/> enterrd, ſay the Records in the Abbey Church of S. Seuerus neer old Florence: and how does this <hi>Sacred Depoſitum</hi> entitle him to you and you to him? If he depoſed his naturall life with you, who can haue better right to his Written life then you? If your Aultars had, and harbourd his Sacred Reliques where can we more propperly Conſecrate the Effigies or Votiue Tablet of his Geſts and Vertues? If he went from you to heauen and eternall happynes, <hi>he</hi> cannot but retayne a gratefull memory of the place which Conſign'd him ouer to the ſame: and euen from his Patronage, not onely from your Highneſſes, I promiſe my
<pb facs="tcp:50961:13"/> ſelfe good ſucceſs in this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. This Congruity is not farr fetchd, nor forc'd, but giues a kind of intrinſique intereſt or propperty; and I am willing to make vſe of it to the honour of the Saint, at which alone I doe and ought to ayme.</p>
            <p>Nor is this glorious Prelate the onely of our Iland which has ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyd your Tuſcany with a holy death, and enrich'd it with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. Another Saint, and King alſo about the yeare 741. Richard by name, Father of the Saints Willebald, Wunnebald, and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burga Virgin, renouncing both Crowne and Kingdome for the loue of Chriſt and a vertuous life, after a long pilgrimage to holy
<pb facs="tcp:50961:13"/> places Settled in fine at Luca and there concluded the whole journey of his life with great opinion of Sanctity; where he alſo was bury'd in the Church of S. Frigidianus, his Tomb being afterwards illuſtrated with many miracles, what euer me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory may at this preſent remayne there of him and them. So that, great Sr., you ſee our fauours from Tuſcany are not groundles, wee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two ſuch noble Pledges there of interceſſion: and who more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull then they, that is, then the Saints, when the Concern relates to the glory of God and aduance of Catholique Religion? And giue me leaue, S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> to aſcribe, and I think not rashly, theſe your
<pb facs="tcp:50961:14"/> preſent pious inclinations towards our Country and diſtreſsd Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to this Originall ſource, the Saints ſeeming to haue infus'd theſe noble Sentiments of a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling reſſentment which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd before from your owne pen, and cannot too often reflect vpon. Theſe pious inclinations haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced great, and good effects, of which we are moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and for which we shall hould our ſelues obliged euer to be moſt thankfull.</p>
            <p>And now I haue ſayd all as to the Apologizing part: what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes to be ſayd further is onely this; that your Highnes will daigne to accept what is ſayd in
<pb facs="tcp:50961:14"/> good part, as alſo what is humbly offerd by ſo vndeſeruing a hand. If it be the firſt from an English pen the nouelty will in ſome ſort recommend it, in hopes it may draw more after it, who will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pley for its deficiencyes; and it is ſomthing to lead the way and break the yce. If others haue, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, (and I wish they may) it willingly for theyr better meritts beggs admittance, at leaſt for the Saints if for none of its owne. As to him, as humbly as hartily I wish you his Patronage, and that he may be as fertile to you in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bleſſings, as he was heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to his country in ſupernaturall miracles; and what miracle but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<pb facs="tcp:50961:15"/> a bleſſing? And Sr. while you haue this Paper-picture before you, if in the peruſall of his vertues you find any thing for your aduance or aduantage in the ſame, I humbly propoſe it to your imitation, as I doe to others. The world is wittnes of your endowments in this, but they muſt be more then very good that cannot be better: nor is it any diſparagement to be ſtill improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſcience of Saints and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian perfection, to which each one in his degree and quality, be he who he will, by that <hi>Eſtote perfecti</hi> of our B. Lord and Sauiour, is oblig'd. What is there prizable in this lifes intercourſe but piety and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, no body being more
<pb facs="tcp:50961:15"/> then he is in that: and what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints this truth more liuely in vs then the liues and examples of Saints? wee ſeeing by what was done by them, not onely what is to be done, but what is feſible to and by vs. This is the thing I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourd to ayme at in this Narratiue, by inſerting reflexions to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and chiefly of the 4. Cardinall vertues. as both propper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all ſtates and conditions. And if your Highnes or any Reader may be benefitted therby to a due diſcharge of theyr incumbent duty in the ſame, I haue my deſyre, which is no other then glory to God, honour to the Saint, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of ſoules in vertu and piety.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE And Geſts of S. THOMAS CANTILUPE. Sometimes Chancellor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and afterwards Bishop of Hereford in the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</head>
            <p>PREFACE.</p>
            <p>THe liues and memory of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Illuſtrious perſons ſeem to carry no ſmall reſemblance with thoſe great Rivers, <note place="margin">Nilus Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Tigris Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> whoſe names and greatnes are as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally frequent in the mouthes of men, as the particulars of theyr courſe and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſcarſe kuowne to any. Nor need we wonder it is ſo, eſpecially in the Saints of God; for Sanctity is alwayes built vpon humility, and with its mantle
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50961:18"/> shrowds it ſelfe from the eyes of the world, neuer better content then when conceald; and the profounder it is, like the ſame Rivers, the leſs noyſe it makes; ſoe that none but an obſeruing eye can diſcouer its courſe. And if this were true in any, it was, I may ſay, in our Glorious Prelate S. THOMAS CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILVPE, Bishop of Hereford; who, the greateſt part of his dayes, as he liu'd to the eyes of men a ſecular orderly but ordinary life, nothing extraordinary to outward appearance, ſo they knew no more of him then what could not be hid, a great vprightnes, ſingular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, vertuous Conuerſation, ſet of with none of theſe ſurpriſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatoryes, Raptures, Viſions, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, which vſually accompany ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. True it is, that the Common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends haue left enough to conuince that he was a great Saint, and wrought many Miracles; Yett if we decend fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50961:18"/> to particulars, we shall find that the greateſt part of what we know o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him is the leaſt part of what we are ignorant, and all compriz'd in a leafe or two. For though he were renownd both at home and abroad for his noble Extraction, Learning, Sanctity, yet he was little knowne as to moſt particulars of his heauenly life, and appeard rather viſible to the world in certain ſummary and compendious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, then in any exact and diſtinct expreſſion of each ſeuerall part or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. When a hidden Sanctity is ſcarce taken notice of, till it be blaz'd abroad with a full noyſe of Miracles, theſe ſo convince the owner to be a Saint, that no body needs to look after any other prooffs of his geſts or vertues to atteſt it, and therfore theſe latter are ſcarſe lookd after or regarded. And if a more diligent ſearch by publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority had not bin made and left on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50961:19"/> in order to his Canonization, wee might ſtill have group'd in the dark as to many particulars which it tells vs: and I recken it among none of the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, that an authentique Coppy theroff came to my hands, while I had thoughts of proſecuting what a devout Client of this Saint had to his honor rather ſcarce well deſigned then halfe finishd.</p>
            <p>There was not a Saint of our English Nation whoſe memory was receiu'd with a more vniuerſall applauſe both of Prince and people then that of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prelate, though the times when he liu'd were moſt unquiet &amp; turbulent, and the employments wherin he was engag'd were of higheſt dignity, and neceſſarily combind with the publique intereſt: which in ſuch a condition of times can haue no more ſettlement then the waues of the Ocean in a raging ſtorme. In the which to ſteer ſuch an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50961:19"/> eeuen courſe as to runn vpon no rock of offence, argues a great deale of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dexterity in the Pilot: nor indeed was there found an enuy (which yet neuer ſpares vertue, eſpecially the higheſt) which durſt faſten tooth on this B. man. Which may well be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among none of the leaſt of his miracles wherwith it pleaſ'd Alm. God to honour him; which were ſo conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous both as to multitude and quality, that he may with rearſon beare the name of Thaumatourge, or wonder worker of the werſterne Church.</p>

Impiety and errour, vnſeparable twinns, borne at one birth, and which euer goe hand in hand togeather, hate nothing more then light, which makes them ſee what they moſt abhorr, theyr owne Uglynes, and the beauty of vertue: to auoyd both, theyr deſire is to bury themſelues and the world in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. They haue not hands long enough to reach heauen, yet doe theyr vtmoſt, with as much folly as fury, to blot out thoſe names on earth which ſtand vpon record in the book of life. In fine theyr malicious attempts haue no other effect, but to make us digg under ruines for treaſure; and, as they were wont to gather theyr gold in Spaine and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they force vs to pick vp here and there a graine out of ſand and grauell.

               <p> Our country of England, though ſeparated by nature from the reſt of the world was not excluded from that vniuerſall influence of deuine grace wherwith it pleaſe'd God to bleſs thoſe times. The blood of the glorious Martyr S. Thomas of Canterbury, as the true ſeed of the Catholique Church, was not ſpilt in vayne; and being in this age yet fresh and warm, brought forth ſpeciall fruit both in Lay and Clergy. But in all none more eminent then another S.

And that it might not fall to a more innocent hand, left no child, but a brother farr worſe then himſelfe; who, that his

And though it is not certaine that Arthur, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd by his Vncles owne hands, as the French do tell vs; yet all agree, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur was put in priſon in Rouen by his vncle King John, and neuer appeard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the manner of his death is beſt knowne to God alone, before whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible eyes all things lye viſible.

Neyther was he onely a Common benefitt and happy preſage to the plublique, but a ſpeciall bleſſing and reward of his fathers loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; who when the greateſt part and

               <p>The Barons with theyr French Protectour were not only maſters of the field both in ſtrength and number, but alſo many months poſſeſs'd of the head Citty of the Kingdom; a thing euer held of higheſt conſequence, as being the ordinary reſidence and Court of Kings, &amp; whoſoeuer winns it ſeems to weare the Crowne. The little king at nine yeares of age, being ſollemnly Crownd at Gloceſter, was in a manner Confind to that Citty and other two, Buſtow and Worceſter: though ſome other particular places and Caſtles in ſeuerall parts of the kingdome ſtood firmly to him. And chiefly Lincolne which was our Orleans, where a lady,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50961:26"/> not inferiour to the french sheepardeſs in Courage, as she was farr aboue her in birth and quality, defended the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Lincolne the ſpace of a whole yeare againſt Gilbert de Gant, a prime Commander of the french forces, though he had poſſeſſd himſelfe of the Towne, and preſſd the Caſtle with a vigorous ſiege. The kings honour, Beſydes his intereſt was Conceiu'd to be not a little Concern'd in the reliefe of ſo much fidelity, eſpecially of ſo rare and vnuſuall example in the weaker ſexe. The Lord Cantilupe therfore with other Nobles of the Royall party, accompany'd likewiſe by the legate of the ſee Apoſtolique, with what power they could make, marchd forth vpon this deſigne. Being arriu'd within 8. miles of Lincolne, they all Confeſſd and receiud the holy Euchariſt, with a plenary Indulgence which the Legate granted them, and ſollemnly declard the

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50961:27"/> and to quitt anothers right not to loſe his owne. In fine our young king was ſo ſettled heerby in his throne, that from this day no rebellion durſt preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me vpon the minority of his yeares, nor attempt his Fortune.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50961:32"/> the king vpon an exigence being to make a voyage into france, could not think of a more powerfull and faythfull hand, beyond all exception and enuy, to intruſt with his crowne and kingdome then VVilliam Cantelupe: it was an equall and happy match between this Lord and the Lady Milleſcenta counteſs of Eureux and Gloceſter, Mother of our Saint.</p>
               <p>She was daughter of Hugh lord Gournay and the Lady Iuliana ſiſter to Reginald Earle of Dammartin and Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne. The Gournay's were of the prime nobility of Normandy, neerly allyd to the ſoueraigne Dukes of that country; and as neer to our gloirous and bleſſed King Edward the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour. The counts of Dammartin were of an inlluſtrious family in france, matchd with the greateſt Princes of Europe. And this Reginald vncle to the Lady Milleſcent in right of his wife

               <head>III. CHAPTER Of his Childhood and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Education.</head>
               <p>TO looke into the infancy or Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Saints may ſeeme as little pertinent to theyr meritt, as to the glory of God: that part of the life of man being Commonly held for a meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or dumb show before a tragedy of miſeryes; a dreame or slumber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſoule awake to the light of reaſon; a ſtate of Neutrality betwixt man and beaſt, as vncapable of prayſe as blame, and onely happy in this, that it is vnſenſible of all vnhappynes. Yett experience and reaſon teaches vs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50961:34"/> that this twylight of life is not ſo dark, but that we may read ſundry charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though written in a ſmall letter, by the hand of God: This mute part of the age of man is not ſo ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but that it fore-tells vs much of what will follow. In fine euen child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood it ſelf hath not ſo little of the man, but that it is capable of deep impreſſions both of grace and reaſon: as the louely and ſweet variety of colours in many flowers receiue theyr firſt tincture in the very root; and the value of Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les depends much vpon the firſt dropps of dewe which falls into the shell when thy are newly engendred. That the divine Prouidence hath a ſpeciall eye vpon the infancy of man is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable truth both in humane and diuine hiſtory: neyther doth this onely conſiſt in certaine prodigyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonſtrations of a power aboue the reach of nature, but alſo, and that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50961:34"/> moſt vſually, in a particular fauour and protection of the diuine hand by connaturall meanes of Education and other circumſtances, to with draw from euill and lead to vertue.</p>
               <p>The whole ſequele of our S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS his life clearly shewes how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was priuiledg'd with both theſe bleſſings from heauen. A nature he had eleuated aboue the Common ſtrayn; a minde full of generous heat and vigour, euer tending to a higher ſphere, like a fire without ſmoke or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of groſser elements: which mett with ſoe noble a temperature of body, that though of a proſperous and liuely habitude, he neuer knew in his whole life what any thing meant which was not agreeable with the purity of Angells. He, the firſt fruit of that happy marriage, was borne at a Mannour of his fathers in Lincolnshyre. Hameldone by name,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50961:35"/> where he alſoe receiud the Sacrament of Baptiſme, regenerated therby to the pretious adoption of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. In memory wherof Edmund Earle of Cornwall, ſonn to Richard once king of the Romans, and a great admirer of out ſaints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, built there an Oratory to the honour of God and his; in the which Oratory our Lord is ſayd te haue wrought frequent Miracles by the interceſſion of the ſame ſaint. Beſydes him his Parents were bleſſd with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous offspring of 3. Sonns and 3. daughters, which like ſo many young Oliues enuironnd theyr table to theyr great loy; and the latter were all beſtowd in an honorable wed-lock.</p>
               <p>To cultiuate duely theſe hopefull endowments both of nature and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce by a Good education was the care and endeauour of his pious Parents: who as in his infancy they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50961:35"/> him of vertuous Nurſe (the Proceſſ of his Canonization calls her deuout, noble, and holy, inſomuch that euen togeather with his milk he ſuckd in Sanctity) ſo in his childhood they were no leſſ wanting to furnish him with fitt Maſters for his inſtruction in theſe firſt rudiments; and this was to be done vnder theyr owne eyes, that they might be wittneſses of all. Thy knew right well how important the firſt impreſsions are in Children, and conſequently how choyſe they ought to be, ſince that tincture is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynd a long time, and giues ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a rellish to theyr proceedings. His Parents were ſo chary in this poynt, and ſollicitous to haue the bleſsing of heauen ſecond theyr induſtry, that we may ſay they imitated dayly the anciente Illyrians, who, when they gatherd theyr ſweet Flower-de-luces lifted them vpp as an offering to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50961:36"/> from whence they had receiud them: ſo theſe noble Perſonages look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon this theyr firſt fruit as a guift of God, and acknowledging it to be more his then theyrs, endeauour'd with all gratitude to make him a fitt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the diuine hand, and to raiſe him from earth to heauen by carefull and vertuous breeding.</p>
               <p>Theyr vſuall habitation was at court by reaſon of the charge which the father of our ſaint bore, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he had of perſonall attendance for the dayly ſeruice of the king. The reputation of Courts hath euer bin as of a place where vertue is laugh'd out of countenance, and denyd admittance, as too Coursly cladd for ſuch fine company. Infamy is no where more in credit, nor vice ſo Canoniz'd: it is a Schoole of Aegyptian Hieroglyphicks where beaſts and Monſters are ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posd to ſignify heroique vertues. What
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50961:36"/> care therfore and vigilancy were theſe pious and noble Parents to vſe in preſeruing this ſweet flower from blaſting vnder ſo malignant a climate? What caution and preuention to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all folly and vanity from the ſight of thoſe innocent eyes? to ſtopp his eares from the leaſt whiſper of charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaſures? What a perpetuall watch and ward, not to lett a word fall, not the leaſt action or geſture appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this little one which might leaue any noxious impreſſion in his tender ſoule? Though to ſay the truth, and to guie thoſe happy times theyr due (which is alſo to be obſerud as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence of God towards the aduancement of our Saint in all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) the ſtile of that Court was farr different from the vſuall Courſe of others, and might well be tearmd a Sanctuary of Piety and ſchoole of vertue.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50961:37"/>
               <p> Such an influence hath the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Princes ouer the harts of men, drawing them whither they liſt with a kind of magnetique force eyther to good or euill. We had then a king who thought it no vnderualuing of Majeſty to viſitt ſpittles and Almes houſes, to ſerue and feed the poore with his owne hands, to embrace and kiſſ lepres. Inſteed of reuells and maſques; his chief pleaſure was in his Chappell, where he heard euery day three Maſſes with ſollemne Muſique, and neuer omitted to be preſent at the reſt, as long as there was a Prieſt at the Aultar; where he euer vsd this Ceremony, in honour to the king of heauen, to ſupport the Prieſts arme whilſt he eleuated the Sacred Hoſt; then with reuerence kiſſd his hand. Inſomuch as his neer kinſman and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law S. Lewis, then king of France, obſeruing that out of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50961:37"/> to the holy Sacrifice of Maſſ, he left no Conſiderable time for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, aduiſd him to allow ſome part of his pious Exerciſes to the word of God: to which he anſwerd, that for his part he had rather ſee his friend then heare him ſpoken of. Our Queen, as long as this king her husband liud, agreed with him as well in piety as in Coniugall loue: and as ſoon as his death left her free to her liberty, she retyrd to a Cloyſter of Conſecrated Virgins, where the world might ſee her hart had euer bin.</p>
               <p>The Conſort of our Prince; Sonn of Henry the 3. now king, and after ſucceſſour by the name of Edward the 1. was a daughter of Spayne, who was ſo little read in the Platonique of our dayes, that she knew not how to loue any thing but Chriſt and her husband; whome she followd through all hazards and terrours to the holy
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50961:38"/> land: where the Prince being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly ſtabbd by a Saracen with a poyſon'd knife, when no skill of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery could preuaile, the inuincible loue of this lady vndertook the cure, and gaue her the courage to ſuck out the poyſon and putrifaction of the wound with her owne mouth, to make it good that loue is as ſtrong as death. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 8 6.</note> The piety of the whole court was anſwerable to theyr Souveraign's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: which appeares euidently in that ſo many of the prime nobility deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theyr liues and fortunes to the ſeruice of the holy land, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ladyes ended theyr dayes in holy monaſteryes.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſ though that court then was ſuch a Paradiſe, the pious and prudent Parents of our ſaint knew well that ſerpents might lurk euen there: Vipers creep into gardens of balſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; poyſons and antidotes often grow
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50961:38"/> in the ſame bed. They were not ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the infirmity of humane nature eſpecially in youth, which like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperd Stomack longs for that which is moſt hurtfull, and in ſuch variety of obiects, as at a full table, ſeldome or neuer feeds without a ſurfett. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolud therfore to place this pretious treaſure, which god had giuen them in a ſafe retreat; as nature or rather the Authour of nature teaches the little Pearles, when they are ſoft and tender in the shell, to retyre under shady &amp; hollow rocks, being otherwiſe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſd to violence of waues and weather, but alſoe ſubiect to change colour and be truly ſun-burnt if they float in the open ſea. They follow'd therfore the aduiſe of the holy Ghoſt giuen to all Parents, if they loue the ſafety of theyr children, to put them under the shade and protection of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, „Statuet filios ſuos ſub tegmine

The child freely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd him, that he would be a Souldier: Well ſayd, ſweet hart, quoth the Bishop, thou shalt be a ſouldier to ſerue the higheſt of Kings, and figh vnder the colours of his glorious Martyr S.

Theſe words prou'd not onely propheticall by the euent but alſo had ſuch efficacy, that the Parents, as in obedience to a diuine decree, directed the whole education of the child to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and learning. And the Child him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as if he had learn'd a new leſſon from heauen, thought no more of thoſe glorious fancyes, to which his owne generous nature carry'd him, and the examples of his illuſtrious progenitours incited him; but with the ſame courage betook himſelfe wholly to his book, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50961:40"/> with the little Salomon preferrd it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thrones and kingdomes. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was truly to be admird in the child and no leſs in his parents, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering not onely the vehement inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men to liue after death in theyr image by poſterity, but much more the hight of theyr fortune, with ſo rich a ſtock of antiquity and honour, preſerud and amplifyd for ſoe many deſcents: wheras if he took a courſe of retyreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from a worldly life and not compatible with ſucceſsion, as his education ſeemd to diſpoſe him, all muſt dye with him and lye buryed in the ſame graue.</p>
               <p>None of theſe reſpects could euer perſwade the Parents of our Saint to let him runn the common race of the world in liberty, in plenty, in wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in exceſſ of vanity and pleaſure, without reſtraint of any thing that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the ſenſuall appetite, foments ſelf loue, and reiects all command of reaſon.

               <p>OUr little S. THOMAS hauing now receiud the firſt tincture &amp; elements of learning at home, both the autority of his Parents and his owne propenſion ledd him to a place of higher improuement, the vniuerſity of Oxford: which was at that time in the primitiue vigour, and eſteemd by all as great a ſchoole of uertue as learning, and therfore the common Nurſery of our chiefe nobility of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geland: a thing continu'd euen to our dayes, though with different ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as but too true experience teaches
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50961:41"/> vs. It was hard to ſay whether Oxford in that age (though it euer bore the pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of antiquity) or Paris had the greater repute and fame of learning. Yet this noble ſtrife bred nothing of that malignity to which the emulous nature of man is but too prone: yea rather main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynd a friendly Commerce, and, as it were, free trade beweene theſe two great Marts of wiſdome and ſanctity. And as thoſe times were fertill of great perſons in all perfections, neyther of theſe two renownd Academyes did ingroſs any aduantage to themſelues, nor enuye the others benefitt; but mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually imparted to each other what was rare and eminent.</p>
               <p>The two glorious lights of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church S. Dominick, and S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis his Orders illuſtrated the world at that time with theyr primitiue ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour, and reuiu'd Chriſtianity with new vigour of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piety. S. THOMAS of Aquine S. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

Bonauenture, &amp; Doctour of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours Alexander of Hales borne in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhyre, maſter of both theſe Saints, with many others of the foreſayd holy Inſtitutes, were the Oracles of that age; and particularly enrich'd and cultiuated the French and English Vniuerſities with theyr admirable doctrine. Among the reſt that famous &amp; learned Prelate Robert Kilwarby was highly eminent; who bred and borne in England, was one of the firſt of that nation who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated him ſelfe to God in the holy habit of S. Dominick.</p>
               <p>But his great abilityes and learning gaue him not leaue to enioy the ſweet retyrement of a Religious life. He was firſt calld by the Sea Apoſtolique to the Primacy of England; in which charge he gaue ſuch teſtimonyes of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable worth, that, Nicolas the 3. who then ſate in S. PETERS Chayre, a great admirer of learning, and vertue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50961:42"/> (which he onely regarded in all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments) to haue his neerer aſsiſtance in the generall gouerment of the whole Church, thought fitt to create him Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall and Bishop of Porto neer Rome, which is the ſecond dignity among thoſe Princes of the Church. The holy Prelat hauing receiud this new addition of honour was ſo farr from that Common diſeaſe and dropſy of Soules, who the more they haue of greatnes, the more they thirſt; that the firſt thing he did was to disburden himſelfe of his Metropolitan charge of Canterbury, not without reſentment and repugnance of the king and all the nobility of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who extremely affected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerened him for his great learning and holynes of life. He left behind him a perpetuall Monument of his piety and loue to his Order, which is yett ex ant, though applyd to a different vſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knowne by the name of Black-Fryars
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50961:43"/> in London. This place when he was Arch Bishop of Canterbury he purchaſd, and built both Church and Conuent for his Religious, whome he transferrd thither from a leſs Conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Reſidence in the ſuburbs. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and humble Carriage of this great Prelat was no leſs admird in the Court of Rome then his eminent parts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling knowledg. He would not cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his poore Religious habitt for the purple of Princes, and was the firſt Cardinall that retaynd his habitt in that dignity; as euer ſynce his example was followd by thoſe who were promoted to that degree of honour from Religious Orders of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtique diſcipline. He neuer appeard in publick but on foot, and neuer had other trayne but two of his owne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious to accompany him, and two other attendants in the nature of ſeruants. In fine though he was admird and honourd as the Oracle of thoſe times, and mouth
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50961:43"/> of the See Apoſtolique, as appeard in that famous treaty and letters written by him in the Popes name to the king of Tartary about the Conuerſion of that nation to the Chriſtian fayth; yett no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could euer lift him the leaſt thought aboue himſelfe out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found humility and pouerty of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man.</p>
               <p>It was a ſpeciall prouidence of God that this great perſon was choſen to be the Spiritual guide and Gouernour of our holy Saint from his tender yeares, which we may eſteem a mutuall happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and honour to them both: being the wiſe child is the fathers ioy, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers worth is the Childrens glory. The learned and wiſe Prelat ſeeing how pure and generous a ſoule he had to mannage, omitted no care and induſtry to ſett him forward to the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Wherin finding his Angelicall pupill ſo ready and pliable, and euen to

He neuer mett with ſtone or bramble in that ſoule to choak or hinder the full fruit of the heauenly ſeed; he neuer found weed in that bed of Lillyes; he neuer ſaw ſpott in that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſtole which he had receiud in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme: Noe flashes of leuity, froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or vnconſtant giddynes ſo inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to that age.

               <p>He neuer omitted to be dayly preſent at the holy Sacrifice of Maſs with all reuerence and attention, which he took for a common duty of all pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50961:44"/> and therfore would oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a greater task, reciting dayly, as young as he was, the Canonicall houres or Prieſts Office, which in him was a remarkable act of piety, and not onely a preſage of his future intentions, but alſo a token not improbable, that euen then as much as lay in him he deuoted himſelfe to a Clergy life: hauing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no tye at all eyther of Benefice or Orders; his yeares being vncapable of the one, and the diſcipline of thoſe better times not allowing Eccleſiaſticall fruits and titles to any other but ſuch as for ability and age could worthily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the functions.

               <head>V. CHAPTER. S. Thomas his Study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</head>
               <p>THat Antiquity plac'd the Temples of theyr goddeſs of learning and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in forts and Caſtles, ſeated vpon a higher ground, and at a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent diſtance from the common habitation of theyr Townes and cittyes, did not onely ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, that wisdome and knowledg is the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50961:45"/> chiefe protection and ſafeguard of men, and a thing highly eleuate a boue the vulgar reach; but alſo that the proper ſeat of learned Exerciſes is to be at a conuenient diſtance from the throng and tumult of the world: this being no leſs an enemy to ſpeculatiue and ſtudious mindes then ſmoak and duſt to the eye, and a confusd and iarring noyſe to a delicate and harmonious eare. This conſiderd, the moſt populous Citty of Europe, and the greateſt court, might ſeem very impropper for the improue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S. THOMAS in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes: eſpecially for his particular, hauing more occaſion of diſtraction then any other by reaſon of his neer relation and allyance with the greateſt Princes of that Court, namely Reginald Count of Dammartin and Boulogne, great vncle to our Saint, and Matilde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of Clermont daughter of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd Reginald, marry'd to Philipp onely
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50961:46"/> brother to Lewis the 8. and vncle to S Lewis who raignd at that preſent time. These circumſtances might well haue putt a youthfull Spiritt vpon other thoughts then ſerious and paynfull ſtudys, and forcd him euen againſt his will to ſpend the greateſt part of his time in receiuing and paying courtly viſitts. But the generous reſolution of the Saint, and the great light which he receiu'd from heauen to make a true eſtimate of things, gaue him ſtrength and vigour to proſecute his courſe without diuersion.</p>
               <p>And ſuch were those happy times, that he found rather helpe then preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in court, where the king a Saint taught the world this truth, that the diſorder of courts is not the fault of the place but men, and that vertue is euer at hand where it finds admittance. Neyther did the court and Army, the two propper ſpheres of this great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50961:46"/> Prince and Soldier of Chriſt, onely partake of his holy influences; he was as great a Patron of learning as Armes; and as piety and diſcipline is the chiefe ſupport and aduancement of both, his powerfull example and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the concourſe of ſo many great perſons renownd for learning and Sanctity, inuited thither by the fame of that happy raigne, gaue ſuch life and vigour to the vniuerſity of Paris, that it neuer flourishd more then in thoſe holy times. The famous Colledg of Sorbone, ſo eſteemd euen till this day, that it is a ſpeciall mark of honour to be a member therof, was then firſt founded, and owes the glory of ſo proſperous a continuance to that happy beginning which made them heyres not onely of the name and patrimony, butt alſo of the eminent learning of theyr worthy Founder Robert de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona. The perſons alſo who then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50961:47"/> taught or ſtudy'd in that vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are a ſufficient teſtimony of the flourishing ſtate of theſe times which bred them whome the Schooles euer ſince haue reuerencd and admird as chiefe Maſters and mirrours of humane and diuine ſciences, and obſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually theyr method and forme of teaching, as the ready and onely way to attaine ſolid and perfect knowledg.</p>
               <p>That S. THOMAS made the beſt vſe of theſe aduantages appears eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by the effect, and that publick teſtimony of his ſingular ability and learning, when hauing finishd that courſe of ſtudyes he proceeded Maſter of Arts, which honour in thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall times was not to be bought with fauour, nor vpon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then deſert. Neyther did he ſatisfy himſelfe with that ſpecious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of his youth, as commonly perſons of his ranke and quality are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50961:47"/> wont to doe, and then apply the reſt of theyr life to the deſignments of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and pleaſure. As after his returne into England he changd not his mind with the place, but ſtill continu'd, like a faythfull louer, his conſtant affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wiſdome, whoſe amiable beauty had ſo poſſeſſt his hart, that it wip'd away all other impreſſions. And that he might enioy his happynes without diſturbance he retyrd from court and the reſtles noyſe of the world to his knowne repoſe and firſt nurſery of his youth, the vniuerſity of Oxford.</p>
               <p>But before he leaue Paris and we conclude this Chapter, it will not be impertinent to our purpoſe to shew what a lilly he was at that time amidſt thoſe thrones of Philoſophy, able enough to choake all ſpiritt and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of piety and deuotion, if great care be not taken; that is, how pure and nice a conſcience he keept, how
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50961:48"/> ſensible of the leaſt blemmish of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection; and this will appeare by an example which ſtands on record, and happend in this interim. While he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy'd his Philoſophy at Paris, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his cloſett was a little at fault, and to ſett it right without trouble or the help of a workman, he ſerud him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of a ſtick or propp of a vine out of the next vineyard. The matter, God wott, ſo very inconſiderable, to an ordinary conſcience would not haue created any ſcruple at all; yett he, though otherwiſe not ſcrupulous, in his tendernes, apprehended the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion ſo deeply, that euen then for its expiation he enioynd him ſelfe a 7. yeares pennance, and each of them with great remorſe confeſſd the ſame. From whence we may gather how Angelically pure that bleſſed ſoule was which checkd ſo reſſentiuely at ſo minute a thing, and how farr it was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50961:48"/> from harbouring any great offenſe which deemd the leaſt to be ſo hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. A tender conſcience is like a tender eye, which the leaſt moat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs and annoyes, making it water to wash of the ſtayne, and expreſs regrett that euer it came there.</p>

               <head>VI. CHAPTER His ſtudy of the Canon-law at Oxford.</head>
               <p>THe reſolution which S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS took after he had ended his Philoſophy with ſuch ſucceſs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſufficiently declares, that his intention was not to make vſe of thoſe ſtudyes as an additionall ornament of his other eminent parts and quality, that as his birth and fortune raiſd him aboue the vulgar ſort, ſo he might alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell them in perfection of mind and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50961:49"/> knowledg. Which could not but be eſteemd a motiue worthy of a generous Spiritt, in ſetting ſo true a value vpon the better part of man, and not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flower and vigour of his age to vannish and wither away without fruit. In proſecution of ſuch happy beginnings, to carry all on before him, and perfect him ſelfe in each kind and for all Callings, he reſolud for his next task to apply his thoughts to the Ciuill law: which, though a hard and knotty knowledg, yett he hopd to draw ſome honey out of theſe flints for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouement. He took it as the Iſraelites did the ſpoyles of the Aegyptians, to apply it to the ſeruice of the true God: and hearing that there was a famous Profeſſour at Orleans who read that lecture with much applauſe, he betook himſelf thither and frequented his Schoole with ſuch eſteem of progreſs, that he farr outſtript his fellow ſtudents
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50961:49"/> being iudgd not onely fitt but fitteſt to ſupply the chayr in his Maſters abſence. This knowledg enabled him much as to the mannagement of ſecular buſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which though it were not the thing he aymd at, yett did good ſeruice therby, and eſpecially in the diſcharge of his double Chancelour-ſhip.</p>
               <p>Having poſſeſſd himſelfe of this ſtudy he vndertook another of ſome affinity but more ſacred, with the former, and that was the Canon-law. This ſuited more with his inclination and intentions, beſydes the ſpeciall prouidence of God which ledd this Saint by the hand from his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and guided him ſtepp by ſtepp to that hight of greatnes to which he had deſignd him both in Spirituall and temporall gouerment; for it ſeems eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that our Saint had euen then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted himſelfe entyrely to the ſeruice of the Church and a Clergy life; other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50961:50"/> what pretenſion could a perſon of his condition haue to apply himſelfe to that ſad and laborious ſtudy of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-law, as voyd of pleaſure as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt, or any other ambitious intereſt, for his particular, being nature and fortune had rayſd him to ſuch a pitch, that he had little need of skill and induſtry to aduance him further. The motiue then of lodging his thoughts vpon this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and learned ſtudy was to enable himſelfe for that holy function to which God had calld him from his very Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He knew that a Clergy life ought to be a shining light not onely in it ſelfe, but to illuſtrate others as well by doctrine as example. He was aſſurd that ignorance in ſuch a ſtate was blindnes in the eye, deaffnes in the eare, a palſey in the limms, and a whole priuation of life and vigour through all the body. That it was to play the Pilot without Card or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50961:50"/> to Command in warr without practiſe of armes or Diſcipline; to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the cure of others without knowledg eyiher of the euills or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyes. Neyther was the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time unſeaſonable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that Study in the prime and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Yeares, when he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prou'd himſelfe in the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Philoſophy, which quickens the mind with a new life, teaches men to ſpeak and call things by theyr true names, giues them eyes to ſee what is inviſible, and makes the ſenſes owne, what they neuer knew, upon the word of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Much about this time while he was delibirating to leaue Paris, a Generall Councell indicted at Lions in the ſame kingdome by Innocent the 4. was to take its beginning on the enſuing feaſt of S. John Baptiſt; it being ſummond not onely upon the ſcore of the holy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50961:51"/> land, but alſo for redreſs of other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaſticall abuſes. The emulous Spiritt of our Saint, deſyrous to benefitt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in each degree, repayrd thither togeather with his younger brother Hugh; knowing well that ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes ſummon, as to a generall Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter what is valiant, ſo to this what is wiſe, learned, and in vertue eminent. He knew that a generall Councell is like a Conſtellation where many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious lights Combine in one to the illuminating of the Chriſtian world, as the great interpreters of Gods will; as an Oracle giuing to know undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly what we are to belieue and doe in the great practiſes of Chriſtianity, and whither can one recurr with more aduantage and ſatisfaction then hither in doubtes of this nature? Theſe two leſſer lights euen then darted forth ſuch conſpicuous beames, that notice being taken of them they were both made
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50961:51"/> Chaplans of the ſayd Pope; and the rather for that beſydes theyr owne Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritts, the preſence of theyr father, ſent thiter by the King of England, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little to this dignity. The Councell ended, our B. Saint return'd full fraught with what he had heard and ſeen, and taking Paris in his way has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd ouer to his Mother Uniuerſity of Oxford, towards the accomplishment of his fore mentiond task of canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law; deſigning when he had Maiſterd it to proceed forth with to his diuinity. But we may ſay that in this he reckond without his hoſt, and while we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, God diſpoſes much otherwiſe: for about 14. yeares interuen'd eer he could beginn the latter and in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim he was to undergoe a double Chancelourſhip both of Uniuerſity and Realme; of both theſe we ſhall treat in the enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p>Coming to this famous Uniuerſity,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50961:52"/> he mett to his great comfort, and as great benefitt of ſpiritt, with his former Ghoſtly father Dr. Robert Kilwarby: who as he had before not only knowne him from his childhood, but alſo layd in him the firſt foundations, of a ſpirituall life, ſo now reſumd againe to the ſame charge, he willingly lent his beſt endeavours to a further advance. The ſpirituall aduiſes of this good man were to our Saint as ſo many Oracles, and as ſuch he receiue them; animated therby to a ſerious progreſs in both his vndertakings of learning and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For we are to aduert that it was his ſettled maxime to make theſe two allwayes individuall companions, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in an equall ballance, ſo that both learning adorne piety and piety learning, each giuing other a mutuall asſiſtance; in ſo much that no applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtudyes could diuert his mind, or leſſen his feruour to devotion and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50961:52"/> vertue. He knew what the Apoſtle ſayd to be moſt true, „ſcientia inflat, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2.</note> that knowledg is a ſwelling vapour, and puffs upp to danger of burſting if it be not keept downe by the waight of piety, and bounded with a profound humility. Want of this wholſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat makes many great witts miſcarry while they will be more witty then wiſe, and learned then vertuous.</p>
               <p>As for the effect and ſuccess of theſe his preſent Studyes, by conſent of all both friends and foes, that is, enemyes of God and themſelves, (for on the ſaints part he neuer bad any, nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition at all, but in the behalfe of God and his right, which he was obligd to maintaine) by common conſent, I ſay he proceded Doctour of Canon-law; and ſo became incorporated into that noble and ancient Uniuerſity, as a principall and Conſpicuous member with a mutuall honour to them both:
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50961:53"/> from whome he was not to part, till by a ſpeciall prouidence of God not onely, with common conſent but vniuerſall ioy both of King and Uniuerſity he was made theyr head.</p>

In the meane time the Uniuerſity is depriu'd of its head or Chancellour, and was to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd: nothing ſeemd wanting in our

               <p>What a Chancelour of an Uniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is can hardly be defind, being his power and office wholy depends upon the nationall cuſtomes and propper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the founders. Buh this is generaly receiud by all, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour is truly head of the Uniuerſity, not onely in poynts of doctrine, but alſo in morall diſcipline and comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Maſters and Students.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50961:54"/> For England, as this office was euer of high eſteem and honour, ſo euen in theſe later times, it is for the moſt part borne by perſons great eyther by birth and dignity, or of eminent power and fouour in court: this being held ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport and protect that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and united Body from all diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and diſquiett.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50961:54"/> as none before or after him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had the like; yett was ſo preſent in the gouerment of his kingdome at home (eſpecially what concernd the nobler and moſt important part of the Common wealth) that is, the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of youth both Clergy and Laity in learning and vertue, that it might ſeem the finall mark he aymd at; and for all his ſucceſsfull proweſſe abroad, that he took it for the greateſt honor to be a feudatary to the ſupreme Dominion of wisdome, and in reall effect did profeſs that infallible and euerlaſting truth, per „me Reges regnant, by mee Kings rule and raigne, from mee they receiue all <note place="margin">

               <p>In this Chayre of autority was S. THOMAS Sett, and it was his ſingular integrity and vpright demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which purchasd him this great and generall eſteem. The truth is, there is no ſuch purchaſer of true worth and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50961:55"/> aſcent to honour as vertue; and this is confeſsd both by friend and foe, euen the latter wher off deemes it praiſe worthy though he can not imitate it, but beholds it as the Owle doth the light with disdaigne. Of his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in this office the Record teſtifyes thus: <q rend="margDblQuots">In quo officio Cancellariae, &amp; in omni ſtatu ſuo, quem ante &amp; poſt habuit, juſtè &amp; ſanctè ſe geſſit, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am veritatis quam prius inchoaverat non dimiſit, ſed ſemper de bono in melius profecit.</q> In which Office of Chancellour as alſo in each other which he bore, he demeand himſelfe with ſuch vprightnes and integrity, that he neuer ſwaru'd from the path of truth which he once trodd, but went on allwayes aduancing from good to better. This aduance was made by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting vettue and learning and depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vice, and idlenes its nurſe; by an impartiall adminiſtration of juſtice to all,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50961:55"/> giuing euery one theyr due, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning Diſcipline in its vigour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſlackning the raynes to a noxious liberty. And as his autority extended both to Maſters and Schollars, and euen to the Citizens themſelues ſo farr as to impede any abuſe towards the former, ſo he carryd an equall hand ouer all, and fayld not therby to pleaſe all. How reſolute and actiue he was in this his proceeding is wittneſsd by a ſcuffle or Riott which happend at that time betwixt the Southern and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Schollars vpon ſome quarrell of emulation: in which the diſorder grew ſo high that to part them he was faine to hazard his owne perſon and to throw himſelfe in to the middle of the throng, out of which he came though with a whole ſkinn yett not with a whole Coat, his gowne being torne and he beaten: yett he Maiſterd the multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, reduc'd them to order, and made

               <p>This of Chancellour was the Firſt publick office which S.

But they like the fountaine of paradiſe were not to be confind to ſo narrow a current, fitt to water the ſurface of the whole kingdome; to which they were both ſufficient, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50961:56"/> the King at the lowd report, which ſounded euen to the Court, deſignd them. He thought that famous Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to little a ſphere for ſo great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes, and that it was an injury to the whole Realme to confine ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to any particular place though neuer ſo honorable, and therfore reſolu'd to make the whole pertake of this vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall benefitt.</p>

               <p>To giue now a ſmall hynt at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this office, it may be obſerud that the word Cancellarius or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ſignifyes not onely now but many ages agoe, an employment or truſt of higheſt concern and honour, next the King himſelfe, moſt eminent for power and autority; and till Sr. Thomas More's time, when worſe changes and innouations followd, the dignity of Chancellour was conferrd vpon ſingle or not marry'd perſons, though Laymen, as not to be vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50961:58"/> of Eccleſiaſticall Prelacy, eyther Arch-Biſhops or Biſhops, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtile of England was. As to the etymology of this word, Caſſiodorus, that learned and graue perſon, deriues it from Cancelli, that is, the grated en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure wherin the Chancellour ſate, ſeparated from the common throng, not to be diſturbd in his office, acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble onely to mens eyes; and therfore the ſame Authour calls theſe barrs or Cancells lightſome doores, open Cloyſters, gates with windowes. This was a friendly admonition or caueat giuen by Caſſiodorus to a Chancellour newly exalted to that eminent office: to putt him in mind, that though he was rayſd and ſeparated from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rank of men, yet he was expoſd to the common view of all, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt proceed accordingly; not pleaſe himſelfe as if he were to dance in a nett, but to aſſure himſelfe that he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50961:59"/> was like to haue as many cenſures and ſharp judgments of him, as men had eyes. Others ſay, he is ſo calld becauſe the Chancellour is, as it were, the mouth, the eye, and eare of the Prince or Soueraigne, and hath the reuie wing of all Memorialls or Petitions preſented to the Prince, and euen decrees of the Prince himſelfe; what he finds not conuenient to Law, or prejudiciall to the Prince's or publick good, it is his Office to cancell or croſs out as voyd and wholly illegall, and not to ſigne it. From this Cancelling or croſſing out with ſuch vncontrould autority, they will haue the name of Cancellarius or Chancellor deriu'd.</p>
               <p>As for the Chancellor of England's office, it is a dignity that makes him eſteemd in the kingdome aboue all, and next to the King himſelfe. In ſo much that on the other part of the Kings Seale (wheroff the cuſtody belongs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50961:59"/> to the Chancellor) he ſignes his owne Orders: that the Kings Chappel be in his diſpoſall and care; that vacant Arch. Biſhopricks, Biſhopricks, Abbeys, and Baronyes, falling into the Kings hands be receiud and kept by him that is the Chancellor: who likewiſe is to be preſent when ſoeuer the King ſitts in Counſell; euen when he is not calld: that all things of the Clark or Clergy man who carryes the Kings Seale, be ſignd by the Chancellors hand; that all things be diſpoſd of by the aduiſe and Counſell of the Chancellor: in fine that by the grace of God, his deſert and meritt concurring, he neuer ends his dayes but in the See of an Arch Biſhop or Biſhop, if he will accept of it. And for this reaſon the office of Chancellor is neuer to be bought, as hauing ſo much connexion and Relation to a Clergy ſtate, for danger of incurring Simony. The manner or ceremony of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50961:60"/> creating Chancellors in the Raigne of Henry the 2. Grandfather to King Henry the 3., who enſtalld S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS in that dignity, was to hang the great Seale about the choſen Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cello'rs neck. But afterwards both the ceremonyes of enſtallment and his court of Chancery was augmented, three ſeales, one of gold, two of ſyluer a great one and a leſſer; and for the Lawyers abuſes and quirkes in the Common law the Chancello'rs court or Chancery erected to moderate all as Vmpire, meerly out of equity and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, independent of ſophiſticall tricks and verball cauills. This was the office of the Lord Chancellor of England ſynce the Norman conqueſt for the moſt part with ſome ceremoniall chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, rather accidentall then in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the Kings who raignd thought fitt.</p>
               <p>In the adminiſtration of this office
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50961:60"/> as our Saint ſhewd great wiſdome, ſo did he alſo great integrity, and theſe two compleated his juſtice; ſo that the former ſecurd him againſt miſtakes and ignorance, the latter againſt bribes and extorſions; neyther of which eyther was or euer could be juſtly layd to his charge. Nay he was ſo ſcrupulously nice in the latter, that he would not haue ſo much as the ſhadow of it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him. It is recorded particularly that certaine Religious men who had a ſuite depending at Law applyd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to him for his fauour and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the diſpatch of the ſame, and therto preſented him with a jewell of value: which he rejected not without indignation, aſking them whether they thought him to be wonn with guifts. Nor was his courage inferiour eyther to his wiſdome or integrity; vpon which account when reaſon and equity dictated that ſuch a thing was to be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50961:61"/> done, he was vndaunted as to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, euen though the king himſelfe ſtood in the way, yett none more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruant of his Majeſty then he. This may be confirmd by what happend at the councill table and was driuen on by many great ones who perſwaded the king to conferr an office vpon a new conuerted Iew wherby he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerd ouer the liues and perſons of ſuch ſubjects as were found to be coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of falſe money. He opposd it with much earneſtnes, ſaying, it was too unlimited a power ouer Chriſtians to be committed to a new conuerted Iew, who might eaſily be tempted according to his former ill habitts to abuſe it: and therfore beſought his Majeſty with teares eyther to reuoke it, or giue him leaue to abſent himſelfe, for he could not approue it. The king mou'd with his teares and candour as well as the force of his reaſons bidding
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50961:61"/> him ſit ſtill, changd ther vpon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. I ſhall ſay more relating to this in the laſt Chapter. Now how ſatisfactory his mannagement of affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in this tickliſh charge was both to Prince and people is euidenc'd by this, that the King vpon urgent occaſions being calld into France, left to him, during his abſence, the truſt and charge of the whole kingdome.</p>

               <p>IN this equall track of juſtice, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neyther to the right hand nor the left, did our Saint walk all the reſpitt of King Henry's life. Full often during this ſpace of time did he ſigh
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50961:62"/> after his former Retyrement, and ceaſd not vpon fitt occaſions to importune the ſame: but the good King who had found his aſſiſtance and dexterity ſo ſeruiceable in the diſpatch of affayres would by noe meanes harken to that requeſt, giuing him leaue to groane vnder his burden: and he in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his will ſubmitted to it, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt of the worſt and a vertue of neceſſity. At laſt, hauing finishd the courſe of nature as well as of a vertuous life, he payd the common tribute of mortality to death, and Edward his eldeſt Sonn, calld the firſt of that name immediately ſucceded in the throne: of whome it will not be amiſs to giue ſome ſhort account, as alſo how things went in the courſe of affayres.</p>
               <p>This Edward was not onely a warr-like but wiſe Prince, and as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiud both Crowne and life from his father, ſo he reſtord both againe, by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50961:62"/> cutting off with his owne hand the laſt and moſt dangerous Rebellion of all. This was raiſd by Simon Montfort a great ſouldier, and of a high Spiritt, otherwiſe a pious and gracious perſon to moſt men, by reaſon of his forward zeale to engage in what he conceiud did concerne the common good: which coſt him firſt expulſion out of France, and after his being receiud in England, and made Earle of Leceſter, noe leſs then his life. This great War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour obſeruing the march and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Prince Edward to giue him battaile, turnd to his Commanders and thus aduiſd them; let vs commend our ſoules to God, for our bodyes are theyrs; as it fell out and he dy'd with the reſt. The ſame great Prince Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the firſt, after he had brought the kingdome of Scotland to the vtmoſt extremity, but preuented by death could not compleat the full conqueſt, he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50961:63"/> chargd his Sonn Edward the 2. or of Caernaruan (calld ſo from his birth in that caſtle) not to enterre his body till he finishd the work begunn by him, of which little remayn'd to be atchieu'd. But thoſe court Paraſites, the young Kings fauorites, hating as death the life of a Souldier, drew him of from that noble deſigne to court againe, to the shame and infamy of the Engliſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wretched end of that vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince. A ſad example of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the laſt words of a dying father, and ſuch a father as England had ſcarſe his like for valour, conduct, and wisdome.</p>
               <p>In the very beginning of whoſe Raigne and firſt ſtepp into the throne S. THOMAS as his place and office requird brought him the great Seale of England, with moſt humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his obligation to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's father for honouring him aboue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50961:63"/> all deſert with that eminent charge, which he reſignd into his Majeſtyes hands with this humble petition, that with his Majeſtyes approbation and leaue, he may retyre to that knowne mother of learning and wisdome Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where he may more enable him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the ſeruice of God and of his Majeſty, and the aſſiſtance of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To which the King anſwerd firſt with thanks, as the manner is, for the great ſeruice done to the King and kingdome; and for his petition, that he aſſented to it, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gaue him full liberty to diſpoſe of himſelfe as he thought fitting. This was it which our Saint, much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Schooles then the court, ſo earneſtly breathd after, and as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully haſtend to them as a ſtone to its Center or fyre to its element; „trahit ſua quemque voluptas.</p>
               <p>And heer I cannot but pawſe a while
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50961:64"/> vpon this noble and heroicall act of S. THOMAS; which if we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by a humane ell and mans naturall inclination to greatnes, was perchance one of the nobleſt of his life. For where in the world ſhall one find euen vertuous and holy men who make not preferrments a part of theyr ayme and reward of theyr ſtudyes, much leſs who will diueſt themſelues willingly of it eſpecially the higheſt, when they haue it in poſſeſſion.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50961:64"/> humility argues a profound ſanctity, and contempt both of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and worldly things.

               <p>Such good ſolid principles made our Saint doe what he did, that is, pray the Saint, that is, deſpiſe and trample vpon that Idol of the world for the loue of heauen and a vertuous life. But though the King liſenc'd him at his requeſt from the Chancellorſhip, yett he ſtill

In which ſtudy, hauing exerciſd himſelfe with his wonted application free from all other diſtraction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion to terrene things, he made ſuch progreſs, that by the votes of all in due time, he proceeded Doctour, of that higheſt of ſciences, which, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall S. THOMAS explicates it out of the Prouerbs chap. 9. v. 3. ſitts like a Queen in Court, and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall Arts ſerue her as hand mayds. And what wonder if his flight were ſo ſoaring, ſynce he had the wings of a

As wiſdome doth not enter into a maleuolous ſoule, nor dwell in a body ſubject to ſinn, ſo when it finds one ſymbolizing with its humour in poynt of ſanctity, and Capacitated therto, it Communicates light as plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, as the Sunn his beames to the Chryſtall.</p>
               <p>How Ioyfully he was receiud in that Uniuerſity, and what wellcomes he had from all the degrees of the ſame, as a thing of courſe is needles heer to be expreſsd. He Coming now in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not of a publick perſon but priuate Student to gaine more time and ſett clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer to his task, wau'd what he could all ſuch diuerſions: his entertainment was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50961:67"/> among his books, and his content in his deuotions; and there he neuer found himſelfe leſs alone then when moſt. He knew what a pretious treaſure time is, and eſteeming it as ſuch, was loath to looſe the leaſt parcell therof: this he did both for his owne benefitt and the example of others, to make them leſs waſtfull of what the moſt part are lauiſh. To this good mannagement of time and his other deuotions he ioynd works of mercy, and eſpecially relief to poore ſchollars, to many wherof he gaue a dayly maintinance, enabling them therby to goe through with theyr ſtudyes; and to this kind of charity he was much addicted, as we shall further shew in the 13. Chapter.</p>
               <p>His thoughts thus diuided betwixt his ſtudyes and deuotions gaue him the fruits of the formers induſtry, and the bleſſings of the latters light. Amidſt theſe he prepar'd himſelfe for his great
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50961:67"/> Act or Commencement, at which his ancient friend and Maſter in ſpiritt, who had taught him many a good leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in that kind, would be preſent, I meane Robert Kilwarby, who though at the time of his Preſentment he were Doctour of the Chayre, yett before the time he was to ſtand in the Act, his great knowledg and eminent vertue had receiud a condigne reward of both, from the hands of Pope and Prince, the See of Canterburry. This made the new Prelate not ſtand vpon his poynts, but as the truly humble, the more they are exalted the humbler they are, ſo this preferrment rather furtherd then retarded him in the reſpect and honour he intended his friend. Friendship is neuer better grounded or ſupported then with piety; none knowing the lawes of that better then this, or keeping them more inuiolably, as leaſt ſwayd by intereſt. Though the meritts of our
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50961:68"/> Saint were ſuch that they needed no commendatoryes, yett to obſerue forme and the vſuall cuſtome, after his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he is bid to withdraw: that done the Arch-Biſhop who came dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne purpoſely to performe the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of his Creation, gaue an ample teſtimony of him, and that upon oath to the preſent Auditory, at what time the ſaint was no leſs then 54. jeares of age. He commended him firſt from the 4. Cardinall vertues and his eminent perfection in each; next from his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular purity both of body and mind, as pure as to both, as he was the firſtday he came into the world. And if, ſayd he, you demand of me how I come to haue ſuch a confident aſſurance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; I answere in the preſence of God, that I haue read it all along as clearly in his life and conſcience by hearing his Confeſſions euen ftom his youth, as any of you in a book legibly writt can
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50961:68"/> read characters layd open to your eyes: nor doe I feare but God, a louer of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who has thus long preſerud him without ſpott, will keep him ſpottles euen till death.</p>
               <p>This was a rare Elogium of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin integrity of our Saint, well worth our admiration and veneration, I may alſo add imitation; it falling eſpecially from the mouth of one who might be accounted an Oracle as to truth, and as free from flattery as intereſt by it. Why then should any one ſuſpect ſuch a disintereſs'd teſtimony of a ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage farr aboue cenſure, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cenſure thoſe that cenſure him? Euery thing is as it is taken: I read this Elogium of a venerable Prelate, and I think I doe prudently in framing ther vpon a moſt high conceyt of the Saints purity: why doe I not? he being one of vnqueſtionable credit: another comes and he cenſures all both Primate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50961:69"/> and Saint, both the teſtimony of this and the integrity of the other. I hold this diſcourſe becauſe Doctour God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win once pretended Biſhop of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and Recorder of all the Engliſh Biſhops liues, vpon the rehearſall of this very paſſage makes this reflexion by way of a prudentiall note; „Omnis homo, ſayth he, mendax; eyther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor or Confeſſed, or the reporter ly'd I doubt not. Whence may be ſeen what gloſs this Hiſtorian putts vpon ſo graue an aſſeueration, and how eaſily he waues any autority beſides his owne. What meanes the man by <q>omnis homo mendax?</q> doth he ayme at the Saint or at the Primate or at himſelfe; for if all be lyars, by conſequence he too; and how non-ſenſically is this thruſt in? What need he doubt but ſuch a poynt of perfection may be aſſerted, and neyther Confeſſour nor Confeſſed, nor Reporter a Lyar? by what Diuinity
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50961:69"/> doth Doctour Godwin conclude this? It may be a wonder beyond beliefe in the Proteſtant church, that any one keep his baptiſmall purity in an integrity of body and mind, but in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique it is not at all; and I doubt as little of this as he of the other. How should we know the geſtes of Saints, ſynce we haue them not by Reuelation, but by the Relation of creditable men? No more Certainly is requird heer then ſuffiſes to ground a prudent beliefe: if euery graue hiſtorian pretend to this, euen Doctor Godwin himſelfe, how much more a Prelate a Primate? But enough of ſuch ſtuff; he would onely haue shewd a piece of his Diuinity, and confirmd it with an I DOUBT NOT, and it ſuffiſes to haue taken notice of its ſtrength. I doubt not for all his doubt but the Primates teſtimony will ſtand good, ſynce ſo many great vertues giue force and warrant to his veracity, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50961:70"/> vpon the ſame, that our Saint, as he deſerues, will be thought to haue preſerud his vnblemmish'd integrity in the candour of its firſt innocency.</p>
               <p>About this time it was while S. THOMAS was attending his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes that Gregory the to. gaue a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the 2.

               <p>Further account of this our Saints Iourney then meerley of his going I find none: he went, I ſuppoſe, in the quality of a priuate perſon, becauſe the Record which mentions it ſpecifyes no more: and going as ſuch (Saints do not vſe to carry any great noyſe or clutter along with them) he returnd when he thought good as ſilently as he went. And this muſt probably haue happend after the time of his Studyes and Graduation; becauſe that paſt and he commenc'd, I find he was immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely calld to a chayre in the ſame Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity where hauing read and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 16. months the fame of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Councill calld him away not by any other Summons then thoſe of his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50961:71"/> owne improuement. For pretenſions of aduancement were as farr from his thoughts as they were from his deſyres or hart: yett honours are like shadowes following thoſe that fly from them, and ſo they did him. For shortly after this his returne from the councill he was choſen to shine in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Magiſtracy, as he had before in the Schooles and ſecular Tribunalls: and how this came to paſs muſt be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the next Chapter.</p>

               <head>XI. CHAPTER. He is made Bishop of Hereford.</head>
               <p>VVE haue hitherto accompanyd our Saint through the priuate paſſages of his life, and beheld him for the moſt part immur'd as it were, within the walls of the Schooles attending chiefly to the perfecting himſelfe not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50961:72"/> others. Not but that he hath appeard, and very illuſtrious too, in the eyes of the world and gloryes of the Court, when made Lord Chancellor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land he diuided juſtice with ſuch an equall and ſatisfactory ballance to the whole kingdome that none beſydes himſelfe was glad at the reſignment. This was but a forc'd lending himſelfe to what he could not with ſtand; or a voluntary admittance of what was putt vpon him whether he would or noe: otherwiſe if it had bin as much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his guſt, as that of the reſt of the world, he would neyther haue ſo earneſtly ſought his owne releaſe, nor ioyd ſo much in obtaining it, as he did.</p>
               <p>Thoſe great talents and abilityes which renderd him ſo recommendable to this, did the ſame to Eccleſiaſticall promotions. It is a prerogratiue which God hath annexd to vertue, that it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50961:72"/> meets, though not allwayes, with many euen temporall rewards when it looks the leaſt after them; and indeed who deſerues them better, or when they haue them can vſe them with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity? His nobility alſo and great allyance gaue no ſmall furtherance: whence it was, that he enioyd at the ſame time by diſpenſation many and fatt benifices, all which according to the Collatours intention he turnd not ſo much to his owne intereſt as to the maintaining and recouering of theyr rights, vpholding priuiledges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing buildings, and relieuing the poore of the reſpectiue neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He was at the ſame time Canon and Chanter of York, Archdeacon and Canon of lichfield, Archdeacon of Stafford, Canon of London and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: all which I rehearſe not as ſoe many Certificates of his Sanctity but as rewards of his meritts, and pledges
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50961:73"/> of reſpect and honour from ſuch Chapters, ambitious to haue him a member of the ſame; and it were to be wishd that ſuch were allwayes in theyr hands who would vſe them to theyr improuement.</p>
               <p>While things were in this courſe, John de Breton a worthey Prelate grouernd the See of Hereford, one well ſeen both into the Canon and Common-Law of the Land which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he illuſtrated with his writings. This man dying in this interim left his chayre vacant to a ſucceſſour, and the care of prouiding a fitt one to the vigi lancy of the Chapter: the carriage of things as to the Election (as we find recorded in the Proceſs of his Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation) was after this tenour. It chanc'd while the Chapter was deliberating about that poynt, S. THOMAS, a canon of the ſame, though his ordinary Reſidence were at Londen, was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50961:73"/> calld downe thither vpon the ſcore of other affayres. The day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixd for the election before his coming, happend while he was there, and he as a member theroff, and of great regard both for his vertue learning, and nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, was deſyrd to preach before the Chapter, and ſo giue a happy entrance to the work. All proceeded Canonically according to method, but yett the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the votes was not ſo cleare and abſolute that day as to decide the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; and tell them poſitiuely this is the man. The next meeting did it; and all the Chapter by ioynt decree, ſayth the Proceſs, did conclude firſt that the party to be elected should be a THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS, and next that the ambiguity of that name should be reſolu'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall THOMAS Cantelupe: whence follow'd an vnanimous accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all, deſyring and accepting and voycing him theyr Bishop. Hence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50961:74"/> he was carry'd to the high Aultar, and a TE DEUM ſolemnly enton'd by way of thanksgiuing with the Uniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall applauſe and good liking of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes himſelfe. For he like one ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizd at vnawares, and expecting nothing leſs then what happend, broke forth into teares, bemoand his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deprecated the burden, alledg'd his owne inſufficiency, and uſd all the arguments he could diuiſe to reuerſe the Election. He did as Saints vſe to doe, who meaſuring themſelues by the ell of theyr owne mean-conceyted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and poyzing the burden which ſuch a charge drawes after it, the eyes of theyr humility makes them deem themſelues weaklings, and the burden like an Aetna inſupportable, well knowing what it is to be accountable for ſo many ſoules. He did like an humble Saint, and they like a wiſe and and Sage Chapter, who knowes thoſe

Wher as Saints who are of a more refind ſight, as ſeeing things by true lights, and meaſuring them accordingly by the Weights of the Sanctuary, make a farr different eſtimate, and proceed quite contrary.

               <p>As the H.

The ſaying of Walter Cantilupe Bishop of Worceſter and his kinſman, vtterd in our Saints childhood concerning his future ſtate of life, cited in the 3. Chapter, ſeemes by the euent to haue bin Prophetique, and as ſuch was receuid by his Parents, who ther vpon directed the whole edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theyr child to a perpetuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in knowledg and piety, the two

It was no leſs remarkable what paſsd while he ſtudy'd the Law at Orleans, and for his excellency in that ſcience ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyd the abſence of his Profeſſor. When the night before he was to read, one of his fellow Students beheld him by way of dreame not onely in the Chayre or Pulpitt, but alſo Carrying a Biſhops Mytre on his head, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or border wherof was full of Croſſes, as ominating that he was to walk by the way of the Croſs full of hardship and contradiction. We may add to theſe a third prediction of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Predeceſſour, who, two yeares before his owne death and the others election, fore-told he should ſucceed him in his charge.</p>
               <p>The choyſe being made and ratify'd to the ſatisfaction of all, the day and place of his inauguration was pitchd on. The day was to be the 8. of Sept.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50961:76"/> ſacred to the Natiuity of the Virgin Mother of God, nor could any other haue fallen more ſuitable to his deſyres, and the deuotion he had for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queen: whoſe Natiuity as it brought a deluge of ioy and happynes to all mankind, ſo he might hope it would betyde no ill preſage to him, who was now to be borne as it were a new man; and moſt willingly did he come into this new world under her patronage, vnder which he was to liue and dye, as all they doe who liue and dye happily. When he had reſolu'd who was to conſecrate him, it was eaſy to conclude on the place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecration: the former reſolue was eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made according to his owne inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for connaturally ſpeaking on whome would he ſooner pitch then on him to whome he was moſt beholding after God for what he had both in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and piety: who as he had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourd

Chapter: onely it is to be noted in a word that the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration was made in Chriſt church Canterbury in the yeare 1275. and of his age about 56.</p>
               <p>In teſtimony of the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent receiu'd by this Election, and the

The more he retyrd into himſelfe, the more he lou'd Retyrement, its ſweetnes being not knowne but by taſting it; and one truth he diſcouerd therby, that a gadding Spiritt wil neuer make a Saint, nor wandering thoughts which goe all day on wool-gathering bring home much ſanctity. He found all in God and contented himſelfe with him alone,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50961:79"/> as well he might; who to a holy Soule is all in all: and it is in ſolitude that he ſpeaks to ſuch a hart, where the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of vertues dwell, not vpon Roads or marketplaces; as Lions and Eagles and ſuch generous Creatures are not found in common woods and fields but ſolitary Wilderneſſes, where they may rule and enioy themſelues vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulld by the vulgar of inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

               <p>What lay not a little heauy on his hart, and was, as I may ſay, the burden of his thoughts, was his new charge, or the ſollicitude of its good diſcharge. To comply duly with this was all his care, and to doe it well, a great ſupply he knew, of vertues was requiſite, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50961:80"/> thoſe chiefly which attend ſuch a function. Thoſe he conceiu'd to be in the firſt place and aboue others Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, he being now a Sheapard that was to keep watch and ſtand Sentinell ouer his Flock: a vertue ſo propper to one thus entruſted, that on it the whole wellfare and ſafety of the ſame Flock ſeems in a manner to depend as to its preſeruation and integrity, both for the preuenting of miſchiefes and giuing redreſs when incurrd. A vigilant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour withſtands the incurſions of wolues and other beaſts of prey, not onely when they appeare in theyr prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per shape, but alſo diſguiſd in the dreſs of sheep; nor is it his duty onely to preuent and repell euill but alſo to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant good: It happend when men were a ſleep that the enemy man found opportunity to ſow tares vpon the good wheat and ſpoyle the harueſt.

This humble condeſcendence gaue him a powerfull aſcendant vpon the harts of the good to incline them much towards vertue and piety, and gaind him ſo much eſteem in theyr affections, that his words were, <q>tanquam poteſtatem <note place="margin">

               <p> This Retyrement as it ſequeſterd his hart and thoughts from the world and its affayres, ſo it gaue him a fayrer proſpect of vertue and its anduantages to Chriſtian perfection, and the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therof towards the due ordering both of body and ſoule. To haue all well, there muſt be a right vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſubordination betwixt theſe two: the ſoule muſt be Miſtreſs, and good reaſon why? the body handmayd and ſubſeruient. Reaſon muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſenſe obey; this will not be done but by a true ſubjection of the inferiour man to the Superiour; nor that, but by frequent pennance and mortification interiour and exteriour, both in mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the flesh, and ſubduing our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and appetites. To effect this the ſeruants of God make warr vpon them <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17.</note> ſelues by chaſtizing theyr bodyes, leaſt while they preach to others, themſelues become reprobate, and to this purpoſe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50961:82"/> embrace the hardshipps of faſting, watching, hayr cloath, and the like to further and compleat the conqueſt of themſelues. And this was the practiſe of our H. Saint as the Recorders of his life and geſts doe teſtify, and had alſo bin through his former age, wearing a rough hayr cloath next his body for many yeares togeather, pennancing his innocent flesh with frequent faſts and watchings. But now he frequented all theſe in ſo much greater perfection, as he conceiu'd the need he had of theyr preſent ſupport to be more preſſing, though not to ſuppreſs any rebellious mutinyes, yett to obtaine greater ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of grace. Yea euen in the houre of his death and amidſt the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of a long and tedious iourny he was found shrowded in one of theſe, as in a coat of male againſt the ſtings of death: as if he intended, according to the Prouerbe, „clavum clauo pellere,

And his feruour in this kind was ſuch, that by theſe and other the like auſterityes he incurrd great infirmityes of body, and was much peſterd with moſt sharp fitts of the cholique, and paynes of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, which with other ſickneſſes gaue him a full exerciſe of his patience for many yeares with no ſmall increaſe of meritt.</p>
               <p>But the vigour of his mind Maſterd all theſe, which ſeru'd onely to render his body or inferiour part more pliant and ſupple in a due ſubjection, wher by his Soule, perfect Miſtreſs of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yealded a rationall obſequiouſnes to God its Creatour, by dilating it ſelfe in prayer, and meditating the diuine perfections with the repoſe of ſo much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50961:83"/> deuotion and ſweetnes, that he ſeemd to be there as in his Center. And it is recorded of him peculiarly, that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour <note place="margin">Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue,</note> Compoſure and recollection in the ſame was ſuch that the very ſight of him was ſufficient to ſtirr vpp both fayth and feruour in the beholders: as alſo that in celebrating the H. Sacrifice of Maſſe, his hart and eyes were ſo diſſolu'd into teares, as if he had actually beheld the bloody Myſtery of the Croſs repreſented to them, ſo liuely was his fayth ſo ardent his deuotion. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd a great loue to this exerciſe of prayer, and deſeruedly, for by it all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enterprizes are atchieu'd, that being the Source from whence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue both light to diſcouer, and ſtrength to act, and courage to attaque, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance to Crowne our vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. By this a ſoule conuerſeth with God and he with it; Conuerſation we know, breeds familiarity, and this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50961:83"/> friendship or vnion of harts; and when one is arriu'd to that, „amicorum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia Communia, what needs he more by way of ſupply then the ſtore-houſe of God himſelfe. Vnion is the reſult of loue, that making the louer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued one, and loue conſiſts in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Communication of goods and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; if we giue, we need not doubt but we shall receiue, his very eſſence being goodnes and bounty. All theſe are the effects of Prayer, and chiefly this vnion which who ſoeuer has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynd, what wants he of perfection? Perfection conſiſt's in charity, which is conſummated in vnity; for then euery thing is deemd perfect when it attaynes its end, and unites it ſelfe to that which is its vltimate Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Conſummation of a rationall Creature is God, and God is in vs and wee in him by charity. Being thus vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God by charity, or as S. Bernard
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50961:84"/> calls it, marry'd to his Word, <q>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas maritat animam Verbo </q>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele is, that as two Spouſes are two in one fleſh by Corporall Eſpouſalls, ſo God and a ſoule become two in one Spiritt by a ſpirituall: and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, aduantages, participations of honours, riches, ennoblement, ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, &amp;c. which are Communicated by the other, are after a much more diuine manner participated by this. What wonder then if our B. Saint endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourd ſo earneſtly an vnion with God, and took prayer ſo much to hart as the begetter of this vnion.</p>
               <p>To maintaine and highten the ſame was all his endeauour; and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourd it by employing to that purpoſe the 3. powers of his ſoule memory, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will in a perpetuall preſence of him. His memory by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting his great and dayly benefitts in a thankfullnes of hart; his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50961:84"/> by meditating his diuine tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, perfections, and attributes; his will by louing him in all, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his to the diuine: and this is the nobleſt employment of a rationall ſoule and an imitation of what the Saints doe in heauen. The more ſtraitly he vnited himſelfe to God the more he did partake of his bountyes, who ſcornes to be out-vy'd by any body in this kind; and this participation increaſd the flame of his charity, which dilated it ſelfe both towards God and his Neighbour, louing God for himſelfe and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in, and for God, and as himſelfe; and this is the fullnes of the Law and Prophetts. Hence he became ſoo Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous both of the honour and Houſe of God, which is his Church, and ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the concerns of his neighbour both ſpirituall and temporall, that he ſeemd to be borne for theyr reliefe, and eſpecially of the poore and needy: of

               <p>TO think that one ſo groundedly maximd in perfection and the practiſe of all ſolid vertue as he was, would rather impayre then improue by his Exaltation, is a paradoxe. <q>Qui <note place="margin">

John, and ſo ſayes euery truly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſoule, whoſe glory is to be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mounting with the ſunn to the topp of his Meridian. All our Saints am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and ſatisfaction was in a happy progreſs towards perfection, knowing that as to its purſuit we are, as it were, in a ſtreame where there is no ſtanding
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50961:85"/> ſtill for the Rower, not to aſcend is to deſcend, and to goe backward not to goe forward. Euen while he was yett a Churchman or Canon he was very much deuoted to almes deeds and the reliefe of the poore; how much was this pious practiſe aduancd when by the impoſition of hands he had receiu'd the H. Ghoſt who is Father of the <note place="margin">Veni Pater pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perum</note> poore, and made him ſuch: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after matters not, the vertue being equally commendable in both ſtates, and we wil ſpeak promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly of it in both.</p>
               <p>Though good words giue but barren comfort to an empty ſtomack yett ſtill it is true, that out of the abundance of the hart the mouth ſpeaks, and then they are onely expreſſions of a willing mind: and howeuer euen a Compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate anſwer is in ſome ſort ſatisfactory. The poore were ſure at leaſt of that from him, if nothing elſe, though he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50961:86"/> ſeldome ſtinted his charity there: and as he eſteemd them the Patrimony of Chriſt ſo he ſpoke with all humility and reſpect to them, as he would to Chriſt himſelfe, knowing that to be done to him which was done to the leaſt of his members. Vpon this account the eſteem he had of them was ſuch that he commonly calld them his Breethren (a name of greateſt loue) and with his good will would haue had all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtiques to haue calld them ſo too, and chidd them that they did not. Whence it is recorded that being ſett at table with halfe a dozen ſuch gueſts, and finding yet place for more, he ſent one of the waiters to the Pallace gate te ſee whether any of his Breethren were there or no; if there were, that he ſhould bring a couple of them along with him. He returning told his Lord there were no Brothers of any Order what ſoeuer; No, ſayd the Biſhop,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50961:86"/> not of this that ſitts heer by me, poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the beggars: yes, my Lord, replyd he, there are at leaſt a dozen ſuch; goe then, ſayd he, and bring 5. of the number along with you, which was forth with done, <q>&amp; impletae ſunt <note place="margin">

               <p>But words be they neuer ſo good are ſtill inferiour to deeds, theſe latter being a better proof of charity as coſting more, and aftording more reliefe. This was the ſubſtantiall part of his loue to the poore, and he was not ſparing of it: he had, to witt, learnd the great leſſon of his Lord and Maſter <q>beatius eſt <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 35.</note> magis dare quam accipere,</q> it is a more bleſſed thing to giue then to take; and he was reſolu'd to practiſe it in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. The recommendation of his owne meritts and noble diſcent had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhd him with a large proportion of Church Reuenues euen before the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his Biſhoprick, which, beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

He knew that the goods of the Church are the Patrimony of Chriſt, and where could he ſpend them better then on the liuing members of Chriſt, eyther to his owne content of mind or ſatisfaction of conſcience. This is the way to grow rich in heauen, and make friends of the Mammon of iniquity, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 16. 9.</note> that, when other meanes fayle, theſe may receiue vs into the eternall taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles: nay euen procure vs temporall Commodityes, ſynce almes deeds layd vpp in the boſome of the poore (this is the beſt way of honouring our Lord by <note place="margin">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50961:87"/> neuer loſt his baptiſmall innocence, but he aymd at a treaſure of meritts due to ſuch works of Corporall mercy, and was to be layd vpp in heanen againſt his reception there, out of the reach of ruſt or moth. Hence he took this vertue ſo to hart that it was very reſplendent in his practiſe, and the poore reſorted to him as to a common parent from whome they neuer departed empty handed. He found it no bad medium to work by the body vpon the Soule; and true, that to gaine this, charity muſt be ſhewd to that: an indiſpoſd body is like an indiſpoſd mind, hard to be wrought vpon while neceſſitous; fill the hand and you gaine the hart, now flexible to any good impreſſions. Our corrupt nature is more ſenſible of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar then of deuotion, and reſſents want of ſuſtenance more then want of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or grace. It is as hard to hammer it to good as a piece of iron to a good
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50961:88"/> ſhape vnles it be firſt made ſupple by the fire of a ſubuentiue charity, this done you may forme it as you pleaſe: Works of Corporall mercy muſt diſpoſe for the ſpirituall. Therfore his cuſtome was to ſeek admittance to the mind by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuing the body, and made it a part of his care to order things ſo, that while he refreſhd this, that ſhould not alſo want its food, partly by pious diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and godly inſtructions, partly by cauſing ſome good book to be read ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the preſent exigence.</p>
               <p>To this ſo laudable and holy practiſe of his former life, he ſeems to haue ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radded this Circumſtance after his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall inſtallment, that what he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this kind by others, he would now doe by himſelfe, and with his owne hands. This is particularly recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, and deſeruedly worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as a great ſuper additionall to the former vertue; for how could he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50961:88"/> his hands now Conſecrated to God more piouſly then by conſecrating them to ſuch an exerciſe of charity? What is laudably done by another is more laudably by our ſelues: God does <note place="margin">

Its good to giue almes by others, but much better to doe it by himſelfe as more merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: one has the meritt both of the almes, and of the manner of giuing it, and the manner in ſome reſpect euen doubles it: for who thinks not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more grac'd by receiuing a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity immediately from the Prince's
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50961:89"/> owne hand then from his ſeruant: the more immediate the influence, the more it is prizd. For theſe reaſons it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a praiſe worthy practiſe in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they doe it not themſelues, to inure theyr children, a part of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to be the Conueyers of theyr al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, vnles other motiues impede: it has not onely a more Comfortable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance both from God and man, but alſo it habituates or rather ſeaſons theſe new veſſells, capable as yett of any tincture, with ſuch a flauour of charity, that many times it ſticks by them theyr whole life long. And perchance our B. Saint took his from ſuch a ryſe of deuotion, or document of his pious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and grew vpp with him ſo pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably that of him it might be-ſayd without rashnes, <q>ab infantiâ crevit <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>How euer certain enough it is that the practiſe is very Chriſtian, and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50961:89"/> much to be recommended, due circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being obſeru'd: and euen while I am reuiewing theſe papers a fresh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for its Confirmation comes from the Emperours Court at Vienna with the acclamation, approbation and alſo edification of all that heare it. The little daughter of the preſent Emperour Leopold (piety being allwayes heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to that Imperiall family, which God long preſerue) feaſted a competent number of poore children of her owne age and ſexe, nor content with this, to compleat the charity, would ſerue them with her owne hands. To witt, ſhe and her noble Parents deemd it nothing vnworthy eyther of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues or her, to ſerue God in his meaneſt members; as being aſcertaind of the truth of theſe words Matt. 25. what you doe to one of theſe little ones you doe to mee. This I alledg to shew that parents need not be shye or nice in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50961:90"/> poynt of apprehending it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſynce they ſee it practiſd by one of the moſt illuſtrious of the world: But it ſuffices to haue hynted this.</p>
               <p>While he was in the Uniuerſityes (and in them he ſpent the greateſt part of his yeares) his charity vented it ſelfe in a particular manner vpon the reliefe of poore Students, therby to enable them to a proſecution of theyr Studyes. This was ſeen chiefly in relieuing the hungry, cloathing the naked, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding neceſſaryes for thoſe in diſtreſs, who muſt otherwiſe haue interrupted theyr courſe both to theyr owne and the vndoeing of many. Its moſt chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to help them who probably are like to be moſt beneficiall to the publique good, and conſequently greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of charity: who hauing bin ſuſtaynd by it haue learnd by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and theyr owne wants what it is to be charitable to others, <q>non aliena
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50961:90"/> mali miſeris ſuccurrere diſco.</q> And what fayrer way towards this enable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then a good foundation of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon which the ſuperſtructures of preferrment may be built both in Church and Common-welth by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments Spirituall and temporall: whence he might ſay, I by my chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes haue enabled ſo many, and putt them in a Capacity to doe the ſame to others: and I think euery one will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaude his placing them ſo well. Vpon this ſcore of loue to the poore he was more ready at all times to heare theyr Confeſſions then thoſe of the better ſort, who could neuer want Ghoſtly Fathers, and thoſe that would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to aſſiſt them, while thoſe of a meaner condition were eaſily putt by, though not by him who equally beheld Chriſt in all, and knew not what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſons ſignify'd. This was ſo remarkable in him, that a perſon of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50961:91"/> quality, who meaſurd all by a worldly ell, objected it as a diſcredit to his byrth and calling; but receiu'd no other anſwere then this: I muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to Alm. God the great Judge, as well for the poore as the rich, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as noble.</p>
               <p>To this he added another but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, yett ſtill to the poore; and with as much or more demonſtration of loue and deuotion as the former. For who more poore then thoſe who are deeply in diſtreſs, and cannot help themſelues in the very leaſt; thoſe whome the H. Ghoſt calls by the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <note place="margin">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50961:91"/> ſynce it will be one day theyrowne caſe. It is recorded of him, that euen while Bishop if in trauelling he mett with a coarſe, he preſently lighted from his horſe and togeather with all his trayne ſayd on his knees a „de profundis„ for the ſoule departed.

S. THOMAS his hart was a heauen, and the Sunn of this heauen was charity, as influentiall as any heauen, and as pure and ſimple as free from all ſelf ended compoſition: like the Sunn it regarded all equally without acception of perſons, hauing latitude of hart to embrace all, and each one in theyr propper quality both noble and ignoble, rich and poore. This Sunn like our Materiall one riſe equally to the good and bad, iuſt and uniuſt: to the former for theyr improuement; to the latter for theyr amendment, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to all, affording both light and heat by word and example: and as he lou'd all, ſo was he belou'd gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by all, loue as naturally exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

               <p>It might truly be verifyd of him what <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 14.</note> the Apoſtle ſo earneſtly recommended to the Corinthians, „Omnia veſtra in charitate fiant„ that all theyr deuoyrs should be done in charity, and ſo were all his actions, all his words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: as iſſuing from a hart all made of charity they carry'd its rellish and parfume, like the plants of Arabia faelix, becauſe rooted in that parfum'd ſoyle, they did partake thence of the ſame fragrant odours.

He had a great ſuite at law with the Earle of Gloceſter and his Officers, from whome in the open Court he receiu'd many vnhandſome and reuiling ſpeeches little beſeeming eyther him or them: all he ſayd by way of reply was this, and he did it with much meeknes; My Lord, ſay what you pleaſe of mee, you shall neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke me to ſay any thing againſt you misbeſeeming; that's not the thing I come for, but to recouer the rights of my Church. Yea this vertue of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient meeknes was ſo remarkable in him, that if any of his ſeruants, no iuſt cauſe being giuen, fretted impatiently at his commands, his cuſtome was to humble himſelfe firſt to them towards a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50961:94"/> reconcilement, as if he, not they, had bin in fault, giuing them ſweet and mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, to shew therby that all was forgott and forgiuen, as not proceeding from paſſion or ſpleen. While he liu'd at Paris, 4. jeares before he was Bishop, he had a Clark in his Retinue who had this cuſtome that, taking his after noon napp, whoeuer awakd him out of it, he would, halfe a ſleep as he yett was, thank him with his fiſt and that very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally with many a blow. It chanc'd one day, no other being at hand, that his Maiſter, vnacquainted with this ill habit, went himſelfe to be his Caller; nor did he fare better then others vſd to doe: to witt, the man not fully him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe fell on his Maſter, and among others gaue him a shrow'd blow on the ſyde. The Saint nothing mou'd or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended heer with made onely this short reply; take heed Child, what you doe, it is a Prieſt whome you beat. Other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50961:95"/> examples of this nature might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgd to shew the abſolute Maſtry he had ouer his paſſions, ſtanding Lord pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount to theyr Controwle when euer there was danger of ouer lashing, and what greater ſigne of an eminent ſanctity?</p>
               <p>Charity is allwayes as peacefull, ſo a peacemaker, in as much as it Ciments vpp all breaches, and concludes all in vnity: and he took this much to hart as knowing that a beatitude was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexd to it, Bleſſed are the Peacemakers. <note place="margin">

As to himſelfe or his owne perſon it was impoſſible to fixe a quarrell vpon him, he eſteeming no loſs greater then that of charity, and would part with any thing rather then infringe it. He
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50961:95"/> knew not what it was to beare hatred or ill will; and to preuent all grounds of miſtake in this kind which might be occaſiond by ill mannagement of affay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, he vſd allwayes to haue able Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and diſcreet Councellours about him, by whoſe prudence and skill he ſo regulated his exteriour judiciall actions, that no place by ſuch a preuention was left for Controuerſyes. Nor was he content to haue them about him, but euery day as ſoon as diuine Office was ended he calld them to Conſult and ſcannd euery cauſe which was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. This muſt needs contribute much to peace, and ſuch an vpright prudentiall proceeding to the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of charity: nor was he content with this care but ouer and aboue he burden'd theyr Conſciences, and taxd them with it if he found any falſe dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among them. All the Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes he had with others were not on
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50961:96"/> his owne ſcore but on the behalfe of his Church, and conſequently not to be deemd his owne but hers: though in other reſpects he were a lamb, yett in her defence he was a Lion, and feard no colours or oppoſition what ſoeuer, nor refuſd eyther labour or danger for the preſeruation of her immunityes. Vpon this account he vndertook a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Rome which coſt him his life, nor could any temporall power, how formidable ſoeuer, appale him when he found juſtice his a bettour: in this a true imitatour of his glorious Patrone S. THOMAS of Canterbury; which his magnanimity ſynce it is to be the ſubject of the next Chapter, I will ſay no more heer then onely to referr the reader to it.</p>
               <p>Now as charity had made him her victime, and as ſuch a perfect holocauſt of loue, no wonder if louing it ſo enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely he hated as hartily its oppoſite and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50961:96"/> Riuall detraction. The horrour he bore to that vice was ſo ſignall that all the Writers of his life take notice of it, and in ſuch expreſſions of auerſion that greater can hardly be inuented. And indeed how could theſe bowells all made of loue doe other wiſe then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre its deſtructiue, a compound made vpp of malice and enuy? It is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of its neighbours good name, a Robber of his meritt and prayſe, a thiefe thats allwayes pilfering ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a poyſonous breath that ſeeks to blaſt whats not its owne, a meer lump of ſelfe loue repining at anothers proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity: He learnd this leſſon of the great S. AVSTIN, who as he was charitably hoſpitable ſo he excluded none from his table beſydes the detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, as the noted diſtick which he putt vpp to that purpoſe doth teſtify. Our B. Saint as he perfectly deteſted this vice in him ſelfe, ſo he could not endure it
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50961:97"/> in any of his domeſtiques; nor did he omitt, when he found them faulty, to giue a ſeuere reprehenſion. One of his Chaplans hauing bin preſent at a paſſage betwixt the Arch-Bishop Peccham and him, wher in the Saint ſeemd to receiue hard dealing both as to words and deeds, the Chaplain in time of table Complaining of it begann to inueigh againſt the court of Rome for its negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in prouiding able and fitt Prelates to gouerne thyer flocks, with much more then needed to that purpoſe. His Lord was preſently mou'd therat, and giuing him a check wishd him to ſpeak more reuerendly and charitably of all, and chiefly of his Superiours and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>It may be expected that treating of his charity to all, ſom thing should be ſayd of it in order to God, whome it regards in the firſt place. It is this loue chiefly which is the fullfilling of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50961:97"/> Law and Prophetts, by which we loue God aboue all, and our Neighbour as our ſelfe in and for God; ſo that this latter part of the Law Cannot ſubſiſt without the former on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. As his whole life was, as I may ſay, one continued or vninterrupted act of charity towards God, by which he was inceſsantly not onely tending towards him but alſoe vnited to him in his deuine grace as will appeare by the reuiew of his vertves; ſoe an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſcope of matter Cannot fayle him that would dilate himſelfe on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (for what are all morall vertues but ſo many iſſues or shoots of charity theyr root?) yett at preſent we will rather ſuppoſe this vertue of vertues then goe about to prove it, and leaue it to be drawen by the reader rather from his other perfections then make a formall draught of it; praiſing it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance as much or more by an admiring
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50961:98"/> ſilence then extenuating expreſſions: for what are the Commendatoryes of our words, to the liuely colours of his vertues?

               <p>THe Church is the Bride of Chriſt eſpouſd at the expenſe of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood, dearer to him then his life, and who euer touches her to wrong her touches the apple of his eye. For her defence and propagation he ſettled a Hierarchy, in which he gaue ſome Apoſtles, ſome Doctours, others Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours; for the work of the Miniſtery and edification of this his Myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50961:98"/> In this Hierarchy, Miniſtery, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Bishops as the immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the Apoſtles Carry the firſt rank both in gouerning and feeding: in feeding is regarded the wholſomnes of the fodder and paſturage, in gouerning, direction and protection; and both theſe require that he be a true Sheapard not a hyreling, and ſeek the good of his flock, not himſelfe. If the hyreling ſee a wolfe Coming, ſayth the beſt of Shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, <note place="margin">

Saint, prouing himſelfe a good Shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard indeed. His loue to his eſpouſd Church was as tender as ought to be to his owne Spouſe, now a Spirituall part of himſelfe and the Spouſe of Chriſt, and he embracd her as ſuch, and togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her eſpouſd all her Concerns
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50961:99"/> whatſoeuer; and this is no more then is ordinarily done euen in Corporall Marriages. It was his deuoir to proue himſelfe a faithfull Menager of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he was entruſted with all, and a valiant maintainer of all its poſſeſſions, priuiledges, Libertyes, immunityes, that in none of them it might ſuffer preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. This he took to hart exceedingly, as deeming it the prime part of his charge, reſolu'd to expoſe and oppoſe himſelfe as a wall for the Houſe of God: and what we are to relate will shew that he fayld not in his reſolution, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it euen with the loſs of his life; and what greater pledg of his fidelity?</p>
               <p>It had bin the deplorable misfortune of our poore Country, that for many yeares, ſucceſsiuely and by fitts, it had bin inuolu'd in an vnnaturall inteſtine warr, which as it cauſd great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ciuill ſtate, ſo did it no little in the Eccleſiaſticall. In ſuch times of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50961:99"/> liberty, abuſes eaſily creep in, an vniuſt inuaſion being much ſooner committed then redreſsd; for when the ſword giues Law, its in vayne for the Croſyer to plead Conſcience, or preach Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, a language little vnderſtood in in ciuill garboyles. The weakeſt, they ſay, goe allwayes to the walls, and ſo does the Church as leaſt able in ſuch occaſions to defend it ſelfe, ſynce it cannot nor muſt not repell force by force; and ſo to redeem vexation is compelld to part with her right eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the inuaders are powerfull. This was the caſe of the See of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford when our Saint enterd vpon it: it had bin vniuſtly outed of diuers large poſſeſſions, and, what made the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery harder, the poſſeſſours had quiett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enioyd them diuers yeares, euen in time of peace, when the lawes had theyr Courſe; his two predeceſſours knowing well the equity of theyr
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50961:100"/> cauſe, but diſpayring to preuayle againſt ſuch potent aduerfaryes; One wheroff was the Kings Sonn-in-law Gilbert Earle of Gloceſter, another Lewellin Prince of Wales, and a third Roger Lord Clifford, beſydes the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Canterbury and others.</p>
               <p>Our H. Saint hauing maturely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd all this, though he found the task very hard, yett relying on the equity of his plea, deemd himſelfe bound, vnles he would betray his truſt, to attempt the recouery of theſe Lands. His courage was ſuch that in Gods cauſe he feard no colour of greatnes, nor multitude of oppoſers; and why should he, ſynce he was armd with the armour of the juſt, a true armour of prooff? hauing juſtice or a good Conſcience for his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sap.</hi> 5. 20.</note> breaſt plate piece, ſyncer judgment for his helmett, and equity for an inuincible shield. Courage and magnanimity is neuer better ſeconded then by vertue
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50961:100"/> and ſanctity, and a good cauſe; when theſe make the onſett, be the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what it will, they Carry all before them. Of his owne nature he was ſo auerſe from ſuites or contraſts, that he would ſooner haue yealded vpp his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate right to an aduerſary then ſought to regaine it by Law; in what belongd to his Church he could not, it being not his owne but Gods who requird it at his hands. But to moderate and faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate all, the beſt he could, the firſt eſſay he made was a modeſt and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full clayme of his right propoſing an agreement on reaſonable tearmes, and in caſe it were refuſd, a ready offer of a Reference; if that were rejected too, then he left the matter to a tryall at law, in which he playd the Sollicitour ſo well, and was ſo diligently watchfull, that he would be preſent at the deciſion though he were carry'd in a litter. This conſcientious proceeding groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50961:101"/> on an equitable right, driuen on by a ſtudious attendance, made him neuer fayle to winn his plea.</p>
               <p>Hence ſuch was the opinion which euery one conceiu'd of his zeale and courage in behalfe of his Spouſe or Church, that, during the time of 7. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res which he ſate in its Chayre, no body durſt preſume to offer the leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on its immunityes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that to offer ſuch a thing were to awake a ſleeping Lion. But this was not enough, his loue and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity aymd at a recouery of what was vnjuſtly invaded and detaynd: in which behalfe though the endeauours of his immediate predeceſſours Peter and John, had bin little ſucceſsfull, being ouer powerd with might, he alſo would try his chance, and began with the greateſt firſt. Wherfore after a legall clayme layd to Malbume Chaſe and other lands and woods ther to adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50961:101"/> wrongfully withheld by Gilbert de Clare Earle of Gloceſter, nor recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any ſatisfactory anſwere towards a reſtitution, he commenc'd a ſuite againſt him, and followd it ſo cloſe, that notw ithſtanding all his greatnes and countenance from the King, cleare juſtice was ready to giue verdict on his behalfe. The Court was held neer or vpon the place controuerted, and the Earle had armd men togeather with his Forreſters, in caſe of being caſt, to keep poſſeſſion by force: and ſeeing things brought to this paſs beſought the King for a ſuſpenſion of the finall Sentence, which was granted. All this nothing abashd the H. Bishop; who going a ſyde to geather with his Clergy into the wood, putt himſelfe in his Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Robes, and them in theyrs with lighted tapers; thus going before them he came to the place where the Judges togeather with the Earle made theyr
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50961:102"/> a bode; where the Candles being putt out, he ſolemnly pronouned a ſentence of Excommunication againſt all and euery one who that day hinderd and moleſted his and the Church of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords right in the ſayd woods and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. This done, the Earle perceiu'd who he had to deale withall, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, taking horſe departed: nor was he ſooner gone then the Judges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to giue ſentence, and that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Bishopp cauſd his ſeruants to hunt as in his owne libertyes through the ſame Chaſe to Regaine poſſeſſion; and he himſelfe for the ſame purpoſe walkd ouer the bounds, vnarmd as he was, though it were not done without danger of his life. For diuers of the Earles men obſtinately perſiſting to maintaine the quarrell, shott at random very neer his perſon without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or reuerence had therto: one of whome more injurious then the reſt
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50961:102"/> he threatned with the diuine reuenge; and the ſame perſon shortly after, ſayth the Record, was miſerably drownd, the Common voyce of all going that it was a juſt punishment for his contemptuous carriage towards the Saint, and well for him if onely a temporall.</p>
               <p>He proceeded much after the ſame fashon with Lewellin Prince of Wales, and to excommunication alſo, for vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſtly detayning 3. villages ſituated neer Montgomery belonging to the ſayd his See. Who lying thus vnder the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure came with the King, as fearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnder his shaddow, into a Church where the Saint was going to Say Maſs. He eſpyd the Excommunicated perſon, and without further comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment warnd him as ſuch out of the Church: the King himſelfe interpoſsd for his ſtay; but all would not doe, nor he beginn till the other had abſented himſelfe, nor could he be admitted into
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50961:103"/> Communion before due ſatisfaction was performd. He was in like manner forc'd to vſe the ſame rigour both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall againſt ſome Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had vſurpt 3. villages of his Territory and defended them by ſtrong hand, till proceeding to the like cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures he frighted them into a reſtitution. Roger Lord Clifford a Neighbourer vpon his Dioceſs had trenchd ſo farr vpon the ſame in time of warr as to driue bootyes of cattle and vſe extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions vpon ſome of the dioceſans. He was too noble minded to denye the fact or putt the H. Bishop to the prooff of it, but now willing to reſtore, all his endeauour was to make ſatisfaction in priuate by ſome Compoſition without vndergoing the confuſion of a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, and to obtayne this he offerd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand no ſmall ſumme of money. He knew not with whome he had to doe, nor the principle, it ſeems, that a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50961:103"/> fault muſt haue a publique penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: the offence being notorious, a priuate attonement could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor the ſcandall taken away till he in perſon in the Church of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford appearing in a penitentiall weed, barehead and barefoot, went in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion vpp to the high Aultar it ſelfe, the Bishop following with a rodd in his hand and according to the canons ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him.</p>

               <p>This Iohn Peccham ſucceeded Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Kilwarby in the Chayre of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury; with whome he carry'd this refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that as the other had bin Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall of the H.

This Iohn, his yeares of Gouerment being expyrd, trauelld through the Uniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of Italy to his great improuement,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50961:104"/> and laſtly to Rome, where the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fame hauing giuen a large cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his eminent parts he was in short time made by the Pope then ſitting Auditour or chiefe Iudge of his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace: in which employment he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd till vpon the Promotion of Robert to his Cardinallship, he ſucceded him in his Arch-Bishoprick.</p>
               <p>No Record that I could meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all giue vs any further account of this controuerſy, then that it was Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, and relating to the priuiledges and immunityes of priuate Sees, on which the Arch-Bishop was thought to trench. A Councill was held by him at Pedding; in the which he is ſayd to haue layd ſome injunctions on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sees vnder his jurisdiction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to theyr libertyes and beyond the verge of his power, as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiu'd; nor were they peculiar to that of Hereford, but ioyntly common to all

And though they were equally concernd, yett no one beſydes our Saint had the courage to vndergoe borh the labour and expenſes and hazards that were annexd to ſuch an vndertaking. They were ſure to haue a very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduerſary, the cauſe was to be tryd in the court of Rome, for that end a journey thither was neceſſary, and a good purſe to defray its charges; all which conſiderd and the doubtfullnes of the ſucceſs, made the reſt of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops hold off and rather be content to ſitt ſtill looſers in what they deemd theyr right, then to incurr ſuch incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſeeking redreſs. This was the ſtate of the queſtion, and in this poſture things ſtood when S.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50961:105"/> on the other, reſolu'd to lend his beſt endeauours, and ſpare neyther paynes nor coſt for rectifying what was a miſs, though it should coſt him a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Rome.</p>
               <p>Thoſe very motiues which daunted the other Bishops were to him ſo many incentiues; he vnderualu'd all labours, he contemnd all dangers, and for what end were the Reuenues of the Church allowd him, but for his owne and the maintenance of the Church and her prerogatiues? All this aroſe from the Zealous loue he had for his ſpouſe, much dearer to him then Rachel to Jacob; for whoſe preſeruation he neyther feard to dye nor refuſsd to liue and ſerue through heats and colds night and day another 7. yeares if ſo it pleaſd Alm. God. And finding that for the good mannagement of his ſuite a journey to Rome was neceſſary, ſynce it could neyther be determind els where, nor

As in this he diſchargd his owne conſcience, ſo was his reſolution ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyd with the acclamations of all ſorts of people, extolling his courage and zeale now, as afterwards they doubted not to aſcribe to it all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which God was pleaſd to work by him, ſtiling him a Martyr like S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS of Canterbury, as looſing his life in defence of his Church, as shall be more fully shewd in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>He took his journey from England through Normandy, and making ſome ſtay in the Abbey of Lira in the Dioceſs of Eureux, this which I am to recount

A child of 3. yeares old wont to play with other children before the Abbey gates, falling into a brook which rann therby, was drownd; the Childs Parents well knowne to the Saint gaue him to vnderſtand the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune befallen them, to whome he ſayd no more then theſe few words, the child by Gods aſſiſtance will liue; and ſtreching forth his hand towards the place, made ther on the ſigne of the Croſs. In the meane while the father of the Child taking it out of the brook found it ſtark dead, full of water and ſand, no ſigne eyther of life or motion remayning in it: he opend the mouth with a knife and letting the water out to a great quantity, to omitt no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he chaf'd the body though hopeles of life before the fyre.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50961:107"/> appeard, and in a competency of time all came to its naturall paſs to the great aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of all preſent. The recouery was held euen then miraculous, but to whome to aſcribe the Miracle they knew not, and to S. THOMAS they durſt not, though euen then venerable for his Sanctity, yett his humility could not brook ſuch extraordinaryes. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when the fame and number of his wonders was divulgd through France it ſelfe, the father of the child before the Lords Commiſſioners vpon the Saints making the ſigne of the Croſs, and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the aforeſayd words, depoſd, that he verily belieud life was reſtord by his meritts and interceſſion.</p>
               <p>He begann his journey in or about the 60. yeare of his age, and not with ſtanding his bodily infirmityes arriu'd there ſafe and well, Nicolas the 4. ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then in the Chayre of S. Peter. How wellcome both the quality of his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50961:107"/> perſon, and character of degree made him is needles to inſiſt vpon, beſydes the fame of ſanctity as well as knowledg which accompanyd him; nor muſt we omitt the ſupperadditionall of being Chaplain to his Holynes conferrd heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore vpon him in the Councell of Lions. Saints carry allwayes with them Letter-Patents of a gratefull Reception, and it is one of the temporall rewards of ſanctity, eſpecially where it is in vogue and has its due reſpect; which if it be not regardable in the holy citty where will it? The court of Rome is the great Patronizer and promoter of Sanctity, where it is as in its center; which though trampled vpon els where, heer finds redreſs, where it has as many aſſertours as it has perſons of eminency, ſuch as haue an ayme to riſe by its Commendatoryes. Vertue is praiſe worthy euen in an enemy, its owne natiue beames and intrinſecall worth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50961:108"/> rendring it ſo, how much more when it shynes in its propper hemysphere enuironnd with lights to ſett it off, not as foyles but like the Moone among her ſtarres. No body prizes vertue more highly then the vertuous, its worth being beſt knowne to ſuch, and none Commends it more then thoſe that practiſe it, its commendation conſiſting not ſo much in words as in deeds. It is ignorance that makes the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it, who if they knew its prizeles value would ſell all to purchaſe it. This preſent Pope was a Frenchman by birth, who beſydes other great parts wher with Nature had endowd him, was ſo farr fauourd by grace, as to be eminent in ſanctity of life; in atteſtation wheroff after death his ſepulcher was gracd with many Miracles, the blind, lame, and dumb finding there a preſent cure. Now what wonder if one Saint giue another an honorable reception? this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50961:108"/> is no more then to giue vertue its due; and from whome may that be more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected then from Saints?</p>
               <p>The legality of Appeales to Rome in Church affayres when a deciſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had in an inferiour court, is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyd by the cuſtome and practiſe of all nations and ages: to her all fly as to a common and disintereſsd Mother who holds the weights of the Sanctuary, and without byaſs and partiality diuides a diſtributiue juſtice according to equity. This is no more then to appeale from an inferiour court to a ſuperiour, which the courſe of juſtice deemes lawfull; nor indeed in our preſent controuerſy which was betwixt a Biſhop and his Primate could any other court giue a finall verdict. To it therfore our Saint appeald, and in proſecution of it made his long journey; and as he was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes happy in this that he undertook nothing but vpon mature aduiſe and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50961:109"/> grounded on the ſound judgment of wiſe Councellors ſo he ſeldome or neuer miſcarry'd in any cauſe, but all being well digeſted the very laying it open prou'd its deciſion. Yett a legall courſe of law was to be obſeru'd, and things by degrees brought to an iſſue; and his was ſuch as he deſyrd, that is, an enioyment of the rights he was inueſted in by the decrees of former Popes, without ſuffering any infringment therin by his Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, who had not power to explicate Papall Conſtitutions, as our Saint ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him in the fore mentiond Councell of Redding, and vpon his owne explication to lay a clayme. Where all proceeds according to rigour of juſtice, fauour pretends no place, nor did it heer further, then to obtaine a quick diſpatch and remouall of thoſe delayes, which render law-ſuites both coſtly and tedious. This was all the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50961:109"/> fauour that was or could be ſhewd him, and he took it for no meane one; lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging as he did after a ſpeedy returne, his hart being at home, where was alſo the chiefeſt of his concerns, while the reſt of his body was at Rome. He did, tis true, by an interiour vnion of mind enioy God euery where hauing long habituated himſelfe in the ſame, but yett his content was in Recollection: he lou'd not the Ceremonious viſitts of courts nor the loſs of time that's made in them, they being toylſomly fruitles and fruitlesly toylſome; while he was Lord Chancellor he felt the ſmart of that, and the ſurfeyt cauſd then, made him leſs able to diſgeſt them all his life after. Yett to omitt them would haue bin deemd a ſoleciſme againſt ciuility, and argu'd at the beſt a ſtoicall ſanctity; therfore who can blame a ſeruant of God if he indeauour to withdraw himſelfe out
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50961:110"/> of the concourſe of ſuch courtshipps: He that touches pitch shall be defild by it.</p>

               <p>HAuing thus obtaynd a fauorable diſpatch and taken leaue of that great court, he putt himſelfe with ioy vpon the way as to himſelfe, though he left it in a kind of regrett for his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the priuation of the ſweet odour of his ſanctity cauſd therby: What is admird as preſent is regretted as abſent, nor doe we ordinarily know the worth of things better then by theyr priuation. It cannot be prudently doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that according to his ſettled practiſe of piety, during the ſpace of his abode there, he left many monuments
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50961:110"/> both of his Wiſdome and Sanctity moſt richly worth recounting had they come to our knowledg. But ſynce they doe not we muſt rather content our ſelues with a patient ſilence, then diſcourſe vpon leſs groundles conjectures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting our ſelues that all is regiſterd in the book of life or Annalls of heauen to be publiſhd at the day of judgment. Nor can I doubt but according to the vſuall ſtrayne of ſanctity, which has for its motto, „ama neſciri, loue Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, he playd the ſilent Eagle, not the talkatiue parrot, and that the courſe of his vertuous actions the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found they were the more ſilent like deep riuers and with leſs noyſe did they imperceptibly flow, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if they eſcapd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>Hauing putt himſelfe on his journey as ſoon as the heats would permitt, all his endeauours now, after Alm. God,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50961:111"/> were to render it as ſpeedy as he could; much reioycing in the ſucceſs of his negotiation, and longing earneſtly to make the concernd neighbouring Churches at home, as well as his owne, partake of the ſame. Thus doe the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt many times project according to humane reaſons and motiues, while reckning, as I may ſay, without theyr hoſt, they propoſe and God diſpoſes. Little did he dreame that his journey was deſtin'd to a better home, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe deſign'd not for new labours but a fruition of the paſt, the euening being at hand when the Maſter of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard was to call his Workman to receyue his hyre, and inuite him into the ioyes of our Lord; a thing if not ſought for yett alwayes wellcome as being the much better home. He was reſignd for life and death putting both in the hands of God; and hauing learnd to poſſeſs his ſoule in patience, he was not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50961:111"/> ſollicitous to dye ſoon or liue long, but to liue and dye well; which latter can be done but once, and giues the vpſhott to all.</p>
               <p>He was now in the Clymactericall yeare of his age 63. and his crazy body was worne out with former labours, and not onely what he now did but what he had done theſe diuers yeares was more by the vigour of his ſpiritt then Corporall ſtrength. This is a thing propper to holy ſoules who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring theyr ability, as indeed they ought, rather by the former then the latter, make this againſt its will keep pace with that, as hath bin obſeru'd in S. Baſil, S. Gregory and others, and eyther by Communicating a new force, or reiecting the ſleeules excuſes of ſelf loue, or by a ſpeciall bleſſing of God they doe wonders in this kind. This vigorous reſolution had now brought him as farr as the ſtate of Florence, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50961:112"/> in it to a place knowne by the name of Monte Fiaſcone; but its ſtock or via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum being ſpent could carry him no further. Heer his debility deſtitute of vitalls for a reinforcement, cauſd a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, that was hightned to a feauer, this in its acceſſes, as a certaine fore runner of death by its ſymptomes, told him that the dayes and wayes of his pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage would ſhortly be ended, and ſo they were, in not very many houres Compaſs, all its periods concluding in one poynt, to witt, Alm. God, in whoſe ſight the death of Saints is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Now we muſt look on him a while as deaths victime, and learne of him how to dye well, which is one of the moſt important arts in the world, for what auailes it if we gaine the whole uniuerſe and ſuffer ſhipwrack of our owne Soules. This maxime was the ſtudy of his whole life, and on it all his principles were grounded, and ſo well,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50961:112"/> that he was not a frayd to look death in the face; he regarding it no otherwiſe then as a paſſage to a better life: and therfore amidſt all its appalements he ſate vpon its Couch as the Phenix on her pile of ſpices, expecting that the ſame flames which conſumd his body ſhould renew his ſoule to a better and immortall life.</p>
               <p>Of this his paſſage I ſhall ſay no more then I find vpon authentique Record, the Proceſs of his Canonization: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on two things; firſt, his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to it, ſecondly the ſequels of it. And as to the former, when he perceiu'd that the euening of life was in a great decline and its ſunn neer vpon ſetting, though his whole life had bin nothing elſe but a preparation to death, or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the ſleep of Saints, by which they reſt in our Lord; yett the neerer it approachd, the more it awakd him to a diſcharge of his laſt dutyes. And
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50961:113"/> therfore with hart and eyes fixd on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the firſt of his deſyres, according to the Rytes of H. Church, were the laſt Sacraments or Viaticum of that great journey, doing himſelfe as he had taught others to doe in that paſſage. Theſe are Confeſſion, Communion, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction which as no good Chriſtian doth omitt, ſo no good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, but has them in eſteem and veneration, and the greater, the better inſight they haue into the Concerns of theyr ſoule and its happy paſſage. Hauing thus prouided for the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall part, all the reſt of his minutes were lett out at the higheſt exchange, and he, vnmindfull of all worldly things, inuokd the Spiritt both of life and light by a„ Veni Creator Spiritus, to be aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to him in this laſt conflict againſt the Spiritts of Darknes, when both life and light lye at the Stake. This done he armd himſelfe with the ſigne of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50961:113"/> croſſe or enſigne of Chriſtianity as formidable to the infernall powers as confortable to a parting ſoule; who whilſt he conſignd himſelfe by it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to Alm. God he added theſe deuout expreſſions taught him probably in his child hood, „Per ſignum Crucis de ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micis noſtris libera nos Deus noſter; and againe, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Per Crucis hoc ſignum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giat procul omne malignum; and laſtly, „Per idem ſignum ſaluetur omne beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum. All theſe are put downe verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim in the record, and teach vs how to arme our ſelues in our laſt Conflict towards a victory ouer our enemyes. This done he calld his retinue about him, and imparting to each, fayth the leſſons of his office, the kiſs of peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with wholſome inſtructions for a pious life, amidſt theſe embracements he took and gaue the laſt adieu. And now by this time the ſtock of life being quite ſpent the pangs of death came
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50961:114"/> ſtronger vpon him, and theſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he betook himſelfe more earneſtly to his refuge of prayer making vſe of that verſe of the Pſalmiſt propper in ſuch a paſſage <q>in manus tuas Domine commendo Spiritum meum, Domine Deus veritatis Commendo Spiritum meum:</q> which words whilſt he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thrice with his hands eleuated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, he renderd his ſweet Soule moſt acceptable to heauen, to be receiud according to its meritts into the eternall tabernacles. This was the ſetting of this ſweet Sunn, shewing much not onely of the Chriſtian but of the Saint, and verifying the old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, „vt vixit ſic morixit, teaching vs that generall rule without exception, he that liues well dyes well. Which Sunn though he went downe in a ſtrange horizon yett found a wellcome in the Ocean of bliſs or a bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the true Chriſtian deemes that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50961:114"/> his Hemiſphere where God places him, we being all Cittizens of the world, and like beggars neuer out of our way while we are tending to Paradiſe. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they that can make a happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of ſo important an affayre, which when thus concluded our work is done; and if not happily alls vndone, and that without redreſs: that is a moment of greateſt moment wheron depends eternity.</p>
               <p>Though his feſtiuity were keept on the 2. of October, yett the day of his death happend on the 25. of Auguſt or the morrow to the Apoſtle S. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew. And ſynce all Authours that I can find vnanimously agree as to the place, to witt that it was neer Monte fiaſcone, one would wonder why Bp. God win in contradiction heer of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alledging any ground for his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, should maintaine that he dy'd at Ciuita Vecchi, and in his way to Rome;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50961:115"/> wheras there are vndenyable prooffs, both of his arriuall there and obtayning his pretentions, returne by land, and holy death at the place aforeſayd. To ſay the leaſt this cannot but argue a ſpiritt of contradiction propper to one of his coat, and little beſeeming the name of a Bishop (nor had he more beſydes the reuenues:) Onely it is a knowne trick of ſuch (I can call it no better) to render the cleareſt truths diſputable, and thence doubtfull, and ſo by degrees eneruate all fayth both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and diuine by vndermining the autority which is theyr baſis.</p>
               <p>It happend the night after his deceaſe that one of his officers whome he had left behind him in England, his name was Robert of Gloceſter, then his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, afterwards Chancellor of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; being at that time at London and Lodging in the Bishops owne Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, had this dreame or viſion, call it as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50961:115"/> you pleaſe. He thought himſelfe to be at Lions in France where in the great ſtreet of that Citty which leads to the Cathedrall, he ſeemd to behold his Lord and Maſter going towards that Church, whither himſelfe was alſo bound. Both being enterd, his Lord, he thought, went into the Sacriſty, where putting of the vpper garment which he wore, he veſted himſelfe with white Pontificall Robes and thoſe moſt rich, and carrying in his hand the Body of our Lord or moſt B. Sacrament in forme of a Conſecrated Hoſt, he appeard ſuddainly in the midſt of a moſt ſolemne and ſtately Proceſſion both of Clergy and religious, and thoſe likewiſe cladd all in white. The Proceſſion ſeemd to moue towards the Cloyſter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall, while others of that quire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton'd and proſecuted with delicate Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique, that part of the Capitulum prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Office of S. Peter ad Vincula,

                  <q>Occidit autem Jacobum fratrem Joan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis gladio.</q> But before all were enterd the gate which led into the ſayd Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, it on a ſuddain was shutt, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert who with many others deſyrd alſo to enter were excluded to theyr no ſmall defeatment, and left to conſider the dreame, of which he as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Saints death could look vpon no otherwiſe then a dreame. But when immediately after certaine tydings both of his death and the preciſe time of it came to be knowne, and that it and his dreame iumpt ſo patt togeather, he could not but think it more then a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that Alm God would intimate therby that as he dy'd, though not in perſecution, yett in proſecution of the rights of his Church, and in ſome ſort loſt his life for the ſame, the Saint had not onely deſerud but receiud the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a Martyr.</p>
               <p>This Relation I haue Coppy'd out of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50961:116"/> the Proceſs of his Canonization where it was juridically depoſd before the Examinants, and approu'd, as ſuiting well with what I ſayd aboue of the Common apprehenſion of all, that God wrought Miracles by him for his actings and ſufferings for his Church. And the ſame Relation adds yett further to let vs know it was more a viſion then dreame, or rather a Viſion by way of dreame, (as is not vnuſuall in H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both old and new) that after this firſt apparition the B. Saint was ſeen often to the ſame party, not indeed, ſayth it, as one in glory, but yett ſuch, as that his ioyfull contentednes ſpoke him to be in a muſt happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50961:117"/> we make afterwards is onely to our graue. Our B.

               <p>The Records tell vs that his ſacred Corps lay expoſd in the ſame place for 6. dayes togeather; and this is but ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to what is done to perſons of his extraction and quality, according to the reſpect euery where giuen them. Though heer another reaſon occurrd which might more then probably auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the ſame: for no ſooner was the ſweet ſoule departed like the extinct
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50961:118"/> flame of a ſtick of parfume, but ſuch a heauenly fragrancy filld the whole room, that it was moſt dilitious to the ſent, and recreatiue to all that were preſent. This, to witt, was a bleſſing redounding to the body for the ioynt concurrence that copartner afforded it in his vertuous excerciſes in the ſeruice of God and his Church; and a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall of the odour of ſanctity of that holy gueſt which lodgd therin. Such ſenſible wittneſſes of an innocent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity in his ſeruants doth Alm. God ſomtimes impart for theyr glory and our incitement, wee being not eaſily mou'd but by our ſences eyther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue highly of them, or be eggd on to imitation, though the odour of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſanctity in it ſelfe farr ſurpaſs what euer is of ſenſe. In the meane time the ſame heeroff together with his death being bruited abroad, as vertue and nobility is euer in eſteem with the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50961:118"/> noble and vertuous, it made many great Perſonages reſort thither and ſome Cardinalls among the reſt, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him during his abode at Rome, or the opinion that went of him, had bin no ſtrangers eyther to him or his perfections. By theyr Concurrence chiefly an honorable funerall was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard for his Enterrment the ſunday following, when he was burryed in the Church of S. Seuerus belonging to an Abbey of that name ſituate neer the old Citty of Florence: at what time a funerall Sermon was preachd by one of the Cardinalls, who could not want matter to dilate vpon while he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his noble diſcent, exquiſite learning, and eminent ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
               <p>All theſe particulars are thus farr mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely ſpecifyd in the Record; but its warrant carry's vs no farther, nor any other that I could meet with as to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50961:119"/> the ſequeles of his Enterrment. And conſequently we are at a loſs both as to that preſent and future times how to know whether any or what publique Veneration was there giuen at any time to his ſacred Corps: or whether gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Miracles were wrought there at, as in England at his Sacred Bones; what memory remaind of him and how long: all this muſt be left to Doomsday book and its Regiſter, when all will be publishd to the glory of God and the Saint, and ſatisfaction of all. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim we may know, that in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church not euery one that dyes with opinion of ſanctity is forthwith honourd as a Saint, the publique Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church, to preuent abuſes and regulate all in an orderly way, is therto requiſite, and nothing permitted but vnder this warrant. He dy'd, tis true, a Saint but his ſanctity was not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torizd: he dy'd a ſtranger and an alien,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50961:119"/> and how little notice is taken of ſuch; 5. yeares elapſd before any Miracles were noyſd abroad euen in England it ſelfe, and 25. before his Canonization: what wonder if the memory of him not preſerud by any ſpeciall graces or ſignes grew cold, and in that coldnes van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishd to obliuion. Though God were pleaſd at his mediation for the comfort of the people, incitement of theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and other reaſons beſt knowne to himſelfe, to work ſuch wonders at his Sacred bones; yett he does this when, and where, and how long he thinks good, and no body muſt preſume to ask, why do you ſo? All theſe are the ſecretts of his Diſpenſations, and he ſays to vs as he did to the Apoſtles „Non eſt veſtrum, &amp;c. it is not for you <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 7.</note> to know times or moments which the Father has putt in his owne power.</p>
               <p>The newes of his death we may imagine brought heauy tydings to his

But theſe are blowes which all muſt be content to ſuffer when God inflicts them; nor is there any redreſs beſydes an humble acquieſcence in his holy will: when we haue payd a little tribute to nature all the reſt is a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue reſignation; who dare ſay to him why doe you ſoe? Yet though his people could not haue him aliue, it would haue bin ſome comfort to haue had him dead, that is, him in his Corps; to the end they might haue enioyd him in his Reliques, which euen then, for the great opinion they had of his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were eſteemd for ſuch. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances that could not be conueniently done; but care was thus farr taken, that the bones being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50961:120"/> from the fleshy parts they togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his head and hart were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into England, and depoſited as a moſt pretious treaſure in the Church of Hereford. Theſe were receiu'd with much Deuotion by the people who went forth togeather with the Chapter and Clergy to meet them, and were enshrynd in the Chapell of our B. Lady in the ſame Cathedrall that they might repoſe in her boſome after death to whome liuing and dying he was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly deuoted, and where could his hart reſt better then in her hands, to whoſe honour he had ſacrific'd both hart and hands?</p>
               <p>Among others whome eyther deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or curioſity mou'd to meet this wellcome pledge, one was Gilbert Lord Clare Earle of Gloceſter; betwixt whome and our Saint, as we inſinuated heertofore there was no good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding vpon the account of ſome
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50961:121"/> lands which the Earle detaynd, and the Saint claymd as due to his Church, and recouerd from him by force of law with much both coſt and paynes. He now approaching to the ſacred pledge it was very remarkable and lookd on as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle by all the Company, that the dry Bones in his preſence begann to bleed a fresh and in ſuch a quantity, that he and all might ſee the Cask in which they were carryd imbru'd with the ſame. The Earle much amazd heerat was ſtruck with compunction, and acknowledging his fault made a full reſtitution of all to the Church, expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by pennance what he had rashly committed, as the onely way to make the beſt of an ill bargaine.</p>
               <p>In the retinue of the deceaſd Bishop the chief mannager of affayres was Richard Swinfield his Secretary, firſt in autority aboue the reſt: he was a Prieſt of great parts and vertuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50961:121"/> for which he was afterwards promoted to ſucceed in that vacant See, and in proceſs of time chief ſollicitour and informer in order to the Saints Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization. To him as ſuch belongd the charge of conueying the Sacred Depoſitum; and he tells vs in his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition before the Commiſſaryes Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall what happend to himſelfe the night before he with it arriu'd at Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. To the end all things might be the next morning in a better readynes, he caſt his journey ſo as to lodge with his Company that night in a village 2. miles diſtant from the Citty: where weary with journeying and going late to bed he ouerſleept himſelfe beyond his time the next morning. His cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was remote from all Company, and ſo high that without a ladder there was no acceſs to the windowes: and yett 3. knocks were giuen as with the knuckle of a bended fingar on the ſame,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50961:122"/> and ſoloud that they ſeru'd for an alarme to awake and tell him it was time to riſe. And in that ſenſe he vnderſtood them, and ther vpon calld vpp his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; concluding with-in himſelfe, that this was a fauour done him by the Saint towards the purſuit and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what they had in hand, to witt the ſolemne Reception and placing of the ſame bones. And what indeed could it be elſe; ſynce humanely ſpeaking no body without a ladder could come there, and looking curiouſly about he ſaw there was none: therfore he aſcribd it to the meritts of the Saint, and very thankfull for ſuch an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to his honour he recorded it to poſterity; making thence a conjecture that this piece of ſeruice, the conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his bones, was acceptable to him, ſynce he had bin pleaſd to giue it ſuch an vnuſuall concurrence.</p>
               <p>While S. THOMAS was yett
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50961:122"/> aliue no body ſeemd to carry a greater reſpect and Veneration for his ſanctity then Edmund Earle of Cornwall, Sonn to Richard King of the Romans. He it was that inuited the Saint to keep his Whitſontyde with him at his Caſtle of Wallingford: where whilſt he ſung the„ Veni Creator Spriritus the ſtrange Miracle of the birds happend, which we shall relate heer after in the 23. Chapter. Howeuer it was procurd, this great Deuotiſt made meanes to gett his Hart, a treaſure he eſteemd aboue any iewells; and to teſtify this eſteem thought he could not honour it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently any other way then by encloſing it in a moſt coſtly shryne togeather with a parcell of our Bl. Sauiours Blood, and founding a Monaſtery of Bons-Hommes at Ashridg in Buckingham shyre to its honour, where it might be dayly and duely venerated to the praiſe and glory of Alm. God, who had raiſd
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50961:123"/> his Seruant to ſuch an eminency of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. This deuout Earle had ſuch a Confidence in his patronage and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that he was wont to profeſs he had not greater in thoſe of our glorious Apoſtle S. Auſtin.</p>

It was done with as much ſplendour as the shortnes of the time would permitt;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50961:123"/> and ſo amidſt all the feſtiualls of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was brought into the Cathedrall, a ſmall parcell, God wott, of what they deſyrd, yett euen as ſuch moſt well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. They wishd him ſuch in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home as they ſent him abroad, aliue and gouerning as theyr Paſtour: they wishd, if dead, not onely his Bones but whole body; for a treaſure the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is the better and more pretious: but as it was, content with what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity impoſd, they lent theyr concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards a ſolemne enterring it in the Chappell of our B.

Heer it was layd in a Coffin of ſtone, and a fayre Graueſtone, ſuch as beſeemd his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, plac'd for a Couer to the Orifice, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, on all ſydes as cloſe and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely as art could make it.</p>
               <p>Heer it lay 5. yeares amidſt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate veneration of deuout perſons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of no more honour then theyr
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50961:124"/> Deuotion gaue it, each one according to the opinion they had of his Sanctity. For though diuers things more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and ſuch as begott much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Veneration were related on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall paſſages, as, the fragrant oudour it exhald, the blood it ſweat, morning call, &amp;c. Yett formall Miracles none were wrought nor pretended to; and the Catholique Church hath allwayes vſd a ſpeciall warynes to preuent diſorders of this nature, that nothing may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely aſcribd before atteſted by legall autority; and we need not doubt but the Saint himſelfe among ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees as he made, had left this enacted. During this interuall of time the Vacant Chayre was prouided of a ſucceſſour; the party elected was Richard Swinfeld of whome we ſayd ſomthing in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter; the ſame that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyd our Saint to Rome, and by his good ſeruices there on his Churches
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50961:124"/> behalfe, as alſo by the ſafe Conueyance of his Reliques had much improu'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the opinion and eſteem of that Chapter. And the prouidence of God, as to this, ſeems remarkable in the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both that none could haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currd more to the glory and illuſtration of our Saint, none knowing him and his meritts better then he, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could be more zealous in that behalfe; as alſo becauſe he was both a great Preacher, truly vertuous, and throughly verſd in the affayres of that Bishoprick, as bredd vpp vnder the Saint. The profound reſpect and zeale he had for his H. Predeceſſour took little content to ſee his bones ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of greater Veneration lye ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely beneath theyr deſert euen as he was a Bishopp, not onely a Saint. Wher vpon he determind a ſolemne Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame to a more eminent and conſpicuous place of the ſame Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50961:125"/> where he reſolu'd to erect a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely Monument of Marble, and haue the action ſolemnizd with the greateſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence he poſſibly could.</p>
               <p>The time pitchd on for this purpoſe was Mandate thursday in holy week; the report wheroff blazd abroad inuited both court and country to honour it with theyr preſence, nor needed many motiues, the opinion they had of him was ſufficient. It was made in the yeare 1287. the 6. of Aprill, the Bishopp and Chapter ioyntly concurring therto: and the place to which it was Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſayth Godwin, was the eaſt wall of the North-Croſs-Ile where yett is to be ſeen, ſayth he, a tomb of Marble. King Edward the 3. in whoſe Reigne it was made was then at Calais, which he had not long before taken from the French King; but purpoſely came ouer out of his deuotion to the Saint, and to grace the ſolemnity with his preſence.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50961:125"/> He and his Nobles, ſayth John Stow, were entertaind at the charges of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Cantilupe, Baron, Coſen to S. THOMAS; Nor did the King miſs of a due reward from the ſayd Saint in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe of his Religiousnes. For while he was attending to that action he receiu'd priuate intelligence of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne on foot for the deliuery of that Towne by a Genowayſe, Emericus of Padua, who liu'd there and was a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Penſionayre of the French King, to him: he playd lack on both ſydes being alſo in ſee to King Edward, who ſuſpecting nothing leſs keept him and his men there for the defence of the Towne. Nor was heer an end of the bleſſing: for the King haſtning to its ſuccour, not onely foreſtalld the others treachery, but with a handfull of men repulſd the numeros enemy, took many priſoners, and putt all in a poſture of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:50961:126"/>
               <p> The ſacred Depoſitum, as we hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, was putt into a ſtone Coffin shutt vpp vnder a fayre great Graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which was to be remou'd eer the Coffin could be taken out, and how to remoue it ſo great and maſſy as it was, gaue no ſmall difficulty naturally ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in that narrownes and ſituation of place. While theyr witts were thus contriuing, two of the Bishops Pages who ſtood by, putt theyr hands to it as it were in ſport to try theyr ſtrength, where 4. of the ableſt could haue done nothing. And heer behold a ſtrange accident: at the ſlender impulſe of theſe two alone the maſſy ſtone yealded and gaue place as farr as was neceſſary for the preſent purpoſe, as if it had bin a thinn bord not what it was. All the Company cryd out a Miracle (for they could aſcribe it to nothing elſe) wrought by the Saint to atteſt his Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and shew how gratefull the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50961:126"/> was to him. But heer was not an end of theyr amazement; yea it was much increaſd, when after the Maſſe of Requiem and ſolemnity ended, tryall was made againe in the ſame manner to putt the ſayd ſtone into its former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; which now thought they had the aduantage of the ground much more then before, not theſe two but neyther teen more ioynd with them, endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with all theyr might and mayne, were ſcarſe able to ſett in its place.</p>
               <p>This was an eſſay or prelude to the manyfold Miracles which immediately followd: for ſuch was the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working power of Alm. God to eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the glory of his Seruant S. THOMAS, that that very day of his Translation 5. Miracles were wrought at his Tomb, and as many each enſuing day for diuers togeather. Nay there was a perpetuall continu'd ſtreame, the ſource being once opend, without ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50961:127"/> for many yeares, of which we shall ſpeake more in the enſuing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Great was the Deuotion of the people in this ſolemnity, hightned we may imagine nott a little by theſe fresh foregoing wonders: and where there is Deuotion God is neuer ſparing of his graces and mercyes; that his Soueraigne Oyle ceaſes not ſtill to runn, ſo long as there are ſuch fresh potts diſpoſd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. Why he reſeru'd theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary bleſſings for this feaſt let vs not curiously enquire of him in whoſe hands is the free diſpoſall of times and moments; but let vs take his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when they come humbly and thankfully, being aſſurd that he knowes better what and when things are to be done then we can tell him.</p>
               <p>In the Translation it ſelfe and time of Maſſe of Requiem ſayd at the new Tombe for the dead (for as yett the Saint was neyther Beatifyd nor Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizd)
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50961:127"/> a man who had bin two yeares blind, and a Woman 8. both of them receiud theyr Sight in the preſence of all the people who were ſpectatours, admirers, and wittneſſes of the Miracle. To giue a particular account of all the reſt that were wrought (though they be all vpon Record and atteſted) would be too tedious, and eſpecially all that were wrought during the Octaue of the ſolemnity (40. in number;) but as Eaſter day by reaſon of its glorious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall claymd to it ſelfe a peculiar ſplendour aboue the reſt, ſo Alm. God ſeemes to haue keept a noted and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cure for it, much redounding to the honour of our Saint, as wrought vpon one both noble of himſelfe and well knowne to all the Nobility of the land, and conſequently more fam'd abroad and divulgd then many others. This was one Milis a famous Warryer, renownd farr and neer for his exployt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:50961:128"/> in Tilting: with frequent falls and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and other misfortunes ſuch a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes came vpon him, that he became contracted in his limbs and they all vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les to him. And thus he remaynd 6. whole yeares, all art of Phyſitians la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in vayne, now an obiect of compaſſion as much as he had bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Congratulation. This man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly knowne to Bishop Richard was by name inuited to the Translation and particularly on Eaſter day when cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with greater Solemnity: the good Bishop intimating with all that diuers great Miracles were then dayly wrought at the Saints Tombe, and who knew but he might haue a bleſſing in ſtore for him. He like one in miſery harkend willingly to any aduiſe that rellishd of redreſs: he made himſelfe be carryd to the Tomb on Eaſter Eeue he prayd there deuoutly the whole night, beſeeching the Saint that as he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50961:128"/> was noble himſelfe he would be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to a noble knight commiſerating his preſent pittifull condition, and vouchſafing him the gracious fauour of a Cure. To render himſelfe better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſd like a good Chriſtian he frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the H. Sacraments of Confeſſion and Communion, and at the time when in the ſayd Church the Myſtery of the Reſurrection ſayth the Record, was that morning repreſented, he found himſelfe ſo perfectly cur'd at the ſayd Tomb, that the ſame day, exulting in our Lord, whole and ſound, he playd the Seruingman at the Bishops table, wayting on him and his other gueſts.</p>
               <p>For a concluſion of this Chapter I muſt inſert a remarkable Cure which was wrought while the ſacred Reliques remaynd yett in our Ladyes Chappell, ſixe dayes before the Translation, that is, the day before Palmſunday, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may deſeruedly clayme to be heer
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50961:129"/> inſerted: it is thus recorded in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiond Proceſs. One Edith wife to a Cittizen of Hereford in the beginning of that ſame lent was ſeizd with a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous phrenzey, and all humane meanes falling short, ſo she continu'd till the day before Palmſunday. The recourſe to S. THOMAS not being as then famd by any Miracles, her husband cauſd her to be meaſurd to a Relique of the H. Croſs much venerated in that Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall, at whoſe Aultar ſhe was keept night and day bound, and attended by two of her ſexe: though at the ſame time she were aduiſd by a Prieſt of the Church to haue recourſe to S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS and to be meaſurd to him, giuing her great hopes of a recouery by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion. All this was done at his ſuggeſtion, and a Candle was made of the thread that meaſurd her, and ſett at her head as she lay bound hand and foot, her ordinary Station being all this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50961:129"/> while at the Aultar of the H. Croſs. The friday before Palme ſunday as she was there hearing Maſs, not onely the candles on the Aultar but all through the Church were on a ſuddain putt out, no body knew how, and a great noyſe like the murmure of a great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was heard at the ſame time: this laſting the ſpace of ten Paters and Aue's, viſibly before them all fire came from heauen and lighted the Candle ſtanding at her head whoſe week was made of the thread that meaſurd her to the Saint. At the lighting of this she recouerd her ſenſes and became well, the Saint at that inſtant appearing to her and bidding her be well: at the ſame time alſo the Cords which bound her of themſelues became looſe, and she in the preſence and hearing of all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating it ouer and ouer againe ſayd aloud where is this S. THOMAS that bids me be well. She went to our
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50961:130"/> lady's Chappell, prayd before his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, a „Te Deum„ was ſung in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the cure, she continu'd as well and ſenſible as euer before; and this was the firſt miracle which the Saint wrought in the Church of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford.</p>
               <p>Upon the Relation of this Miracle it occurrs to mee that ſome peruſer of the ſame may check perchance (as it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eaſy to find fault) at one or two paſſages mentiond therin: the which to cleare vpp by way of preuention will happily not be vnacceptable. One may be, her leauing the H. Croſs and its Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar to betake herſelfe to S. THOMAS: in which if there were any fault, it was was the Prieſts who aduiſd her to it; which could not be great, it being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the good miraculous effect immediately enſuing. Neyther did he disſwade her from the H. Croſs whoſe efficacious vertue is venerable
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50961:130"/> to all Chriſtians, but onely perſwaded her (whether by diuine inſtinct or the impulſe of his deuotion matters not much) to make her recourſe to God and it by the mediation of the Saint. His deuotion to S. THOMAS mou'd him to vrge this recourſe, which, if vpon the opinion had of his Sanctity, he aduiſd, where is the errour? Nay it's glorious to the H. Croſſe, as it is alſo to honour God in his Saints, (ſo farr is it from diſparagement to ſee its ſeruants honourd and inuokd: beſydes that a new Starr may many times and without prejudice to the Sunn, draw more eyes to it then the Sunn it ſelfe, and haue its influences more cry'd vpp: both deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were compatible and good, nor doth the latter derogate from the former.</p>
               <p>Another perhaps will be diſſatisfyd, yea euen a little ſcandalizd at this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring to the Saint, and ask what it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50961:131"/> meanes? Truly I do not remember to haue read it elſwhere, nor is it any Eccleſiaſticall Ceremony of any Church, much leſs of the Catholique: it ſeems to haue bin taken vpp by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the people therabouts, and, as an innocent harmles expreſſion of theyr deuotion and recourſe to the Saint, approu'd by cuſtome; and though frequently us'd, yett not ſo of neceſſity, but that it was and with equall ſucces as frequently omitted, at leaſt not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond. This theyr recourſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Saint was twofold; and the miraculous effects as to both shew its acceptablenes to him: eyther by bending a piece of ſiluercoyne ouer the patients head who ſought redreſs to the honour of the Saint, appropriating the party by this expreſſion to him and his peculiar patronage for redreſs: or elſe by meaſuring the ſayd client by a thread or ſome ſuch thing, that is, by taking
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50961:131"/> his length and breadth with the ſame intention as in the former, and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting them at his Aultar or to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The manifold miraculous effects enſuing heer vpon vindicate the fact from all ſuſpition of irreligioſity and ſuperſtition: and if the Saint was pleaſd to accept it, let not vs harbour a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice againſt it. When we ſee the Candle whole week was made of this meaſure miraculously and before all the reſt lighted from heauen, let vs take that Miracle for an approuement of its inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; all's well when all's meant well: <q>alius quidem ſic, alius autem <note place="margin">1, <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Which Authours when they haue conſignd his vertues ouer to vs with this ſeale of deeds and deliuerd them vnder ſuch a Conſignment, (they hauing before ſignalizd them with words;) it cannot be denyd but all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall formalityes are obſerud, and that they ought to ſtand in force as a deed ſignd ſeald and deliuerd, according to the tenour of our Courts of juſtice: and why should not Saints in heauen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take theroff as well as Sinners on earth? to deny it them were a great inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>Theſe Miracles took theyr ryſe or ſource from his Translation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd theyr ſtreame ſome ages togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in treating of them we will not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50961:133"/> launch forth into theyr mayne of all particulars, for ſo we should looſe our ſelues without end, but onely cruzing neer the Shoare paſs as ſwiftly as ſafely through ſuch an Ocean. The firſt I cite in this behalfe is Laurentius Surius a graue and exact Authour; who out of one Anonymus or Conceald ancient Writer but judicious, teſtifyes that among the Miracles which ſtand vpon record, our B. Saint is found to haue reſtord from death to life 66. ſight to the blind 41. vſe of theyr limbs to the Contracted or ſinew-shrunk 52. Palſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck 21. and he recounts onely what came to his knowledg, not that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to know all. Doctour Nicolas Harpsfield Prebend of Canterbury and a diligent Collectour of the Geſts of our Saints makes ſuch a like Relation; who ſpeaking of our glorious Saint and his eminent vertues tells vs they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to vs and future poſterity
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50961:133"/> vnder the atteſtation of frequent Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, 163 wheroff were wrought, ſayth he, in the Compaſs of a few yeares, and renderd his meritts famous farr and neer for the ſame. John Capgraue expreſſes himſelfe in this ſort as to the Saint and this poynt of his Miracles, where he ſayth: The Miracles which after his death Alm. God was pleaſd to shew to vs Sinners in euidence of his ſanctity and to the honour of his owne name, (for God is honourd in his Saints) I ſaw, ſayth he, at his Tomb, regiſterd in diuers volumes, and they were in a manner infinite. In one wheroff, ſayth the ſame, I counted 425. wrought by S. THOMAS at his Shryne, all mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effects, many wheroff were in the cure of different deſeaſes: and euen Bishop God win himſelfe, a meer pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket in this Kind filching away what euer he can, grants that many Miracles are ſayd to haue bin wrought at the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50961:134"/> plare of his buriall, in regard wheroff it pleaſd the Pope to make him a Saint. Thus doth he mince the matter which he dares not deny, not yett can Confeſs without a cleare condemnation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his breethren, who pulld downe a Church and fayth, ſo ſtord and confirmd with Miracles, to ſett vpp a Chappell of theyr owne building, to verify the old Prouerb, where God has a Church the Diuell will haue a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p>The laſt Confirmation which I bring of his miracles and theyr multitude is be yond all exception to any vnpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced judgment, for I borrow it from the very authentique Acts and Records ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridically prou'd and approu'd in the Proceſs of his Canonization. A coppy of theſe ſame Acts and Records taken by a friend of mine of vnqueſtionable ſyncerity out of the Originall which is keept in the Vatican Library I haue at
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50961:134"/> this preſent lying by me; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I haue or shall ſay concerning his miracles is all or in greateſt part bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowd from thence. There I find vpon Record in all 429. and them examind and approu'd partly by the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners deputed by his Holynes then liuing, for that end; and partly by 4. au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriz'd Notaryes. The Lords were the Bishop of London and Bishop of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat, who ſate ſome times at S. Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines London, ſom times at Hereford, to avoyd charges in the Citation of witt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: they were commiſſiond onely for 4. months and in that time they could examine noe more then 39. miracles all which they ſubſcribd. The 4. Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes were a kind of ſtanding Committee for that purpoſe, whoſe power ſtood good without limitt of time or ſtint of autority; and all the force of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the reſt haue is deriud from them. And thus much in generall is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50961:135"/> to aſcertaine vs both of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditablenes of what we alledg, and to shew how highly he was in fauour with Aim. God: for all theſe being things aboue the ordinary Courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they require a ſpeciall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall concurrence, a thing meerly of grace, and not granted but vpon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary exigencyes for the illuſtration of the power of God in his Saints and to lett the world know how wonderfull he is in them; „Mirabilis Deus in Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis <note place="margin">

Not that all that doth not carry them is ſpurious, or that all Saints

               <p>Now to ſatisfy the Deuotion of the Reader, or rather to enflame it the more, we will deſcend in particular to relate ſome few of ſo many miracles, and giue a little ſcantling theroff; which as they are particular pledges of Gods ſpeciall fauour towards his ſeruant, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſpeciall incentiues to vs of a peculiar reuerence towards the ſame.</p>
               <p>One Juliana liuing not farr from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford in her Childbed fell into ſuch a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50961:136"/> Contraction of all her limbs, that she became wholly deſtitute of theyr vſe, and this for the ſpace of 9. yeares togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All humane remedyes prou'd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull to her cure, and how to obtayne diuine she knew not: the fame and name of S. THOMAS was then not blazd abroad, though it happend after his death, and while his ſacred bones lay bury'd in our Ladyes Chappell. Yett the charitable Saint had a kindnes for the poore Creature, and appearing 6. ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times to her, wishd her to goe to the Tomb of Bishop THOMAS which was in our Lady's Chappell at Hereford, and there she should be curd. She ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew what Bishop THOMAS nor Lady's Chappell meant, but vpon ſo many warnings reſolu'd to ſend her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to Hereford to learne by enquiry what they might meane. He went, he informd himſelfe, he returnd, yett the diſabled wretch lay languishing a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50961:137"/> whole yeare before she could reſolue to be carryd thither. The bruit of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Translation quickned her deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little, and being carryd in a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett was plac'd in our Lady's Chappell at the Saints Reliques: there falling into a ſlumber he appeard to her againe bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her riſe and goe to the new Tombe; she made what shift she could to gett to it, nor had she ſooner touchd it and ſayd a few prayers, but by leaning on it she roſe, found her ſelfe well, and walkd thriſe about it, and the next day home without any help. The baskett in which she was brought she left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her at the Tomb; but it being bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowd of a poore neighbour who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her baskett againe, Iuliana the next morning ſent for it and reſtord it to the owner. But what much hight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Miracle was this; the baskett was no ſooner taken away but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man relapſd into her former Contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50961:137"/> it ſeems the Saint requird it for a monument of his charitable redreſs. What remedy now? she is carryd againe to his Tomb and in the ſame bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kett, remayning ſo amidſt teares and prayers a whole day and night: the next morning her good Benefactour mindfull of his patient reſtord her limms once more to a full and perfect vſe of them, and leaſt she might incurr a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond forfeyture she preſumd no more to take away the baskett.</p>
               <p>A publique Incendiary was taken in flagrante, and deſeruedly by the Lord of the Mannour, who had legall power, ſentencd to the gallowes which was executed, and he lay there a ſad ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of juſtice with all the certain ſignes of a dead man in ſo much that now they thought of nothing more but his bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The lady of the Mannour a very vertuous matrone, and her daughter like herſelfe, hauing theyr charity not ty'd to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50961:138"/> meritt, much beyond his deſerts, had a great mind to haue him thus as he was meaſurd to S. THOMAS in hopes of a reuiuall; Confiding ſurely that the latter part of his life would be more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatiue then the former. In fine she did it and not once or twice but thriſe with much deuotion ſeconded with the feruent prayers of all that were preſent. Her fayth was equall to her hope and charity, and all three ſo acceptable to the Saint that vpon this deuout petition, as a prelude to what would follow, the dead body mou'd firſt one foot, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann to breath; the eyes which hung gaſtly vpon his cheeks fell back of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to theyr propper place, and ſo did his tongue to its: in fine there was a perfect recouery from death to life; and he is ſayd, (and no great wonder it should be ſo) to haue mended his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners very much, and behau'd himſelfe through all like a good Chriſtian.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50961:138"/> It is not granted euery one to dye twice.</p>
               <p>The palpableſt of miracles or raiſing the dead was ſo ordinary with our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saint that 40. ſuch like reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtand vpon a juridicall record. Our Lord and ſauiour has the ſole Dominion of life and death, keeping in his owne hands the keyes of both without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule; yett ſo, as that he lends them ſomtimes to his ſeruants who, what they doe, is by his power and diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as are alſo all the miracles which they work, not done by theyr propper vertue but his Concurrence who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates it: and thus he wrought with our Saint, who will ſay, as did S. Peter to the Iewes, <q>Viri Iſraelitae quid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramini, <note place="margin">

In this kind a little Child ſcarſe 3. yeares old playing with another of the ſame age on the bank of a fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, the other to frighten this, made as if he would thruſt her in, and she out of feare fell in indeed, and was actually drownd before the miſchance knowne or help could be giuen. This pond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longd and was neer to an Alehouſe where ſtore of Company, was at the ſame time making merry, and among the reſt the Parents of the child: ſo cloſe many times and vnexpectedly doth ſorrow follow myrth at the heeles, das<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing the wine of comfort with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of teares, ſuitable to that of the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, „Extrema gaudii luctus occupat; and thus many times is all the ſport <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 14. 13.</note> ſpoyld. The Child is taken out lifeles, and while they are all lamenting ouer it, the Father, who had heard much of the miracles wrought by S. THOMAS, togeather with all the company recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50961:139"/> the matter with much Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Saint, and with his girdle meaſurd her to him according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. Thus they all perſeuerd praying, and on theyr bare knees, ſayth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, till next morning without any ſigne of life: in the morning naturall heat came into her body, motion of her limbs followd that, and ſpeech motion, and ſo by degrees came perfectly to her ſelfe. This miracle was among the firſt which Alm. God wrough by his Saint, and it being noyſd abroad people came farr and neer to behold the Child: it was alſo the firſt which was ſolemnly examind and approu'd by the Lords Commiſſioners. She liu'd till she came to womans eſtate, but could neuer be perſwaded by her Parents to marry though much urgd therto; and therfore was Commonly calld by the name of S. THOMAS his Vingin.</p>
               <p>A poore man by an vniuſt oppreſſion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50961:140"/> of his Land-lord was caſt into priſon and ſo loaden with irons that the weight of them broke his left arme. In this ſad Condition both of want and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all humane meanes fayling him he ſought diuine, and had recourſe to our Saint; making a vow that if he cur'd his arme and reſtord him to liberty, himſelfe would make a pilgrimage to his Tombe. He found a propitious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone; his arme was forth with Curd, and he eerlong releaſd from hold. But alas! a good purpoſe is ſooner made then keept; he that ſayd VOUETE ſayd alſo REDDITE, which latter part was wholly neglected by this vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Client, who now hauing obtaynd what he deſyrd thought no more of what he promiſd, and ſo it fares with a great many. The Saint ſent him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer, and he fell into a grieuous fitt of ſicknes, and in it into a phrenſey, in a rauing transport wheroff his arme
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50961:140"/> is broken againe and in the ſame place. Being fallen a-ſleep he ſeemd to ſee the moſt glorious Mother of God, and heare her ſaying to S. THOMAS who ſtood by her, friend, help this poore Caytiff: help him? replyd he; he made a vow to viſitt me before this, and has not bin ſo good as his word. Ah, ſayd the ſweet Mother of mercy, he will come to you, help him, I pray: Let him then come, replyd the Saint on Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday and he shall be curd in the name of our Lord. Which ſayd they both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeard: and the ſick man relating the Viſion to the byſtanders was carryd by them on that day to the Saints Shryne where he found redreſs of both his maladyes by the interceſſion of the moſt glorious Virgin and the meritts of the Saint.</p>
               <p>One of Staynes not farr from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don became ſo infirme that all preſent judgd he could not liue one houre to an
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:50961:141"/> end. This extremity or infirmity was the leaſt part of his miſery: for he found himſelfe haunted and obſeſs'd ouer and aboue with multitudes of Diuells in moſt hideous Shapes which not onely beſett him, but ſome taking him by the head others by the feet they hal'd and pulld him almoſt to pieces. The poore ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man halfe diſtracted had recourſe as well as he could to Alm. God, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the meritts of his deuout Seruant S. THOMAS of Hereford to afford ſome aſſiſtance in this dreadfull agony. And behold, while he ſilently thus recommended himſelfe he ſaw the man of God forth with approaching him, and claſping his head betwixt his hands ſtood in his defence againſt theſe wicked Spiritts the greateſt part of that night. About break of day putt to flight they all vannishd, the Saint ſtill holding the Sickmans head as before; who ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly awaking out of his ſleep, and his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50961:141"/> ayde or helper withdrawing at the ſame inſtant, he found himſelfe perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtord to health both of body and mind by the powerfull mediation of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Champion who came ſo ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to his reſcue. To whoſe Tomb therfore by way of thanksgiuing he with his Neighbours vndertook bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fout a long pilgrimage, and there in each ones hearing atteſted the cure.</p>
               <p>To lett vs know how dangerous it is to meddle with edg tooles, that is, to jeaſt profanely with the proceedings of Saints, making a piece of drollery of what we ought humbly to venerate if we do not vnderſtand; a youngman Flemming by nation and ſeruant to an English Lady of quality, (he was better fedd then taught) being in a Cittizens houſe in Hereford, among other Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, began to ſpeak ſcurrilously of our B. Saint, ſaying, that while he hu'd he was certainly of a couetous humour,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50961:142"/> ſynce after his death he receiues ſo many pretious guifts refuſing nothing that was offerd him. While he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumd to goe thus on, one of his hands ſuddainly shrunk vpp with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of payne, that acknowledging his fault he was forc'd before all preſent to inuoke the Saint for redreſs: which no ſooner deſyrd then obtaynd ſo cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable was he towards him, the hand being preſently reſtord, and all as well as before. But ſee the inueteratenes of an ill cuſtome! shaken off, it recurrs againe and clings to vs like a ſecond na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The vngratefull wretch thus curd attributes both the payne and cure to a naturall cauſe, and neyther the latter to his benefactour nor the former to a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of his profane ſcurrility. While he was vttering theſe words, ſo violent a payne and Contraction ſeizd the ſame hand a ſecond time that no ſtroke but one from heauen could cauſe
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50961:142"/> it. Affliction giues vnderſtanding, and ſo did it him; he acknowledgd the hand of God vpon him for his ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and now hartily penitent calld vpon the Saint and deſyrd all the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders-by, to doe the ſame. Theyr pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers were preſently heard, his hand reſtord, and he learnd more witt then to relapſe the third time. Let vs learne hence to deteſt atheiſticall drollery, and ſerue God and reuerence his Saints in whome he is ſo admirably admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>The next I will relate happend in the perſon of Bishop Richard the ſo often mentiond ſucceſſour to our Saint: He in the firſt yeares of his Epiſcopacy was ſo ill of the ſtone that both Phyſitians and others lookd on him as a dyingman, nor for the ſpace of 5. or 6. weeks did he ſtirr out of his Chamber. His Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlane who depoſd this cure, ſleeping one night in his Lords Chamber to be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50961:143"/> ready on all exigences, ſeemd in his ſleep to heare one ſay to him, ariſe, take the Relique which thou haſt of S. THOMAS (it was the firſt ioynt of his right thumb, and no body beſydes himſelfe knew of it) wash it in the wine which in a ſiluer Cruett ſtands in the window, giue thy Maſter to drink of it, and he shall be curd. The Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane eyther miſtruſting the call and its effect, or fearfull that the wine might not be good for his Lord, diſſembled the matter nor took notice of it, chiefly indeed for feare of looſing his pretious Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>que, which he deemd to pretious for him to keep were it once knowne to others. The next night he heard the ſame call with a menace for his former neglect; yett he out of the precedent motiues forbore alſo the ſecond time: the night following or 3. he ſeemd to behold our B. Lady accompanyd with many Virgins all which were clad in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50961:143"/> white and enuironnd with great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes entring the Chamber in which the Bishop and his Chamberlane repoſd, and coming neer to the latters bed, who for ſome dayes before had with much deuotion beſought her attiſtance by the meritrs of S. THOMAS for his Maſters Recouery; ſayd to him in French, ſayth the Proceſs, Deynſe (that was the Chamberlains name) art thou asleep? he anſwerd no: ryſe then, ſayd she, take the wine aboue mentiond, and if thou doeſt it not, at they perill be it. This laſt threat made a deeper impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as ſoon as it was light he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the matter with the Bishops Confeſſour and Phiſitian to know theyr judgment vpon the matter: with theyr approbation and in theyr preſence he washd the foreſayd Relique, and the Phyſitian gaue 3. ſpoonfulls of the ſayd wine to the Bishop wishing him to drink it: he making the ſigne of the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50961:144"/> Croſs did ſo, riſe immediately, went downe to the Chappell which he could not doe for ſo many weeks, heard Maſſe, and remaynd all that enſuing yeare as free, as if he had neuer bin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted ther with.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this preſent Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue with another depoſd juridically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Commiſſioners by the party concernd then liuing, who in his younger dayes had once bin a meniall ſeruant of the Saint, but marrying after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards liu'd at London and by trade was a Barber. This man vpon the ſuddain without any viſible occaſion loſt firſt one eye then the other, and both with ſuch exceſſe of payne that it made him ſeek all humane redreſs, though in vayne, and try the skill of Chirurgery, which not withſtanding he remaynd 3. yeares ſtark blind, faine to be ledd whither euer he went and he dayly did to S. Paules Church to heare Maſs.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50961:144"/> Much diſcomforted with this accident he calld to mind his old Patron and great well wisher S. THOMAS now Canonizd a Saint and working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. He recommends himſelfe moſt earneſtly to him and our B. Lady; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her by the deuotion he had to her to obtayne of Alm. God a cure of his miſery and reſtorement of ſight that he might againe to his comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her Sonn in the Conſecrated Hoſt, while it is eleuated for all to adore.

The Commiſſion took date the 13. of Iuly 1307. and was to continue but 4. months: which limitation of time and multiplicity both of Wittneſſes and Miracles was the reaſon why they could not inſiſt vpon or paſs through all: but as many as were examind by them eyther in order to his vertues or miracles, all Depoſitions paſsd vnder oath, the H.

The information being taken as aboue, and a due returne made to the Congregation of Rites whome ſuch matters concerne, all being adjuſted according to forme, HIS HOLYNES Iohn the 22. at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our King and Prelates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to a Canonization, which was ſolemnizd both at Rome with vſuall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiualls, and to the vniuerſall ioy of the whole Kingdome, much more in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and chiefly in the Church of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford. Though the day of its ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation be not ſpecifyd, yett we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly think it was on the 2. of October, on which day the Church celebrates his yearly memory, though it be otherwiſe certainly knowne, as we ſayd aboue,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50961:148"/> that the day of his depoſition or death were on the 25. of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>The fame of his ſanctity atteſted ſo many yeares by a world of miraculous Cures of all Kinds to all ſorts of people, did not bound it ſelfe with in our owne Iland, but working at Sea as well as at Land, and paſſing our ſtreights it filld both France and Italy as well as Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ireland: and as all receiu'd a new acceſs of ioy by this new acceſs of honour, ſo euery one ſtriue to putt on a new feruour of deuotion ſuitable to his meritts and theyr obligation. A new declard Saint is like a new Starr in the Pirmament, he drawes as many harts as that doth eyes, and if the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the latter be more viſible the Communications of the former are more benigne and obliging. A flame of deuotion which is continually nourishd with the oyle and fuell of ſucceſſiue bleſſings need not feare a decreaſe of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50961:149"/> heat, and ſuch was the peoples towards our Saint. One King and two Queens haue. bin ſeen proſtrate Pilgrims before his Tomb, nor was theyr Majeſty euer more gloriously great, then when thus humble before Gods Seruant: ther's noe truer greatnes then that which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from a profound humility. All the Princes and Nobles of the Land imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theyr example with votaryes in theyr hands: the greateſt Prelates and theyr Clergy were the firſt in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship, nor was it then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuperſtition or idolatry to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in his Saints. How happy was the people of this Kingdome in ſuch a propitious Patrone where in theyr greateſt plunges of neceſſity, they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely as it were to ask and haue, if the grace were fitt to be imparted, and they diſpoſd to receiue it: his Shrine alone being a Pharmacopaea or Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory of Receypts for the Cure of all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50961:149"/> maladys euen death it ſelfe. And thus it continud many yeares to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Comfort of all, and doubtles would longer, had we remaynd ſtill in the Vnion of Gods Church and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Saints, members of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body which onely partakes of the diuine Influences of itts head Chriſt IESUS.

               <p>And all theſe with in the ſpace of little more then the firſt 20. yeares after his Translation, and before his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization. What may we conceiue of the whole age or two next enſuing? to what a maſs would they probably

Thoſe to whome the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyture of all did eſcheat, when of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique worshipp all became Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant profanation, thoſe, I ſay, could haue informd vs more exactly if they pleaſd: for though they loue not Saints nor theyr Shrynes; yett they can both fingar and deuoure all the Donaryes which hang at them of what mettall ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, without the leaſt ſcruple of Conſcience or indigeſtion.</p>
               <p>According to the drift of my firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne heer should my Narratiue make an end, it being no part of my intention to bulk it further with his Miracles; and we haue touchd vpon all the chief paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his life which haue come to our knowledg.

               <p>I Will heginn with his humility as the foundation and preſeruer of all vertue and ſanctity; the ground work on which all ſpirituall edification, that is,

And in this it ſquares very propperly; for as the mortar not onely combynes, but lyes conceald and is not ſeen, ſo humility though it giue luſtre to other vertues yett it conceales it ſelfe, carrying for its motto, „ama neſciri„ loue to lye conceald. What charity is in Theologicalls the ſame is humility in Moralls: as that perfects the former, ſo this the latter; in ſo much that neyther the vertue of pennance, nor mortification, nor obedience, of which S. Leo ſayth, that nothing is hard to the humble, nor pouerty, nor pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nay nor euen charity it ſelfe can ſubſiſt without humility, ſynce this

               <p>It is propper to this vertue to empty our ſelues of our ſelues, that is, of ſelf loue and ſelf eaſe, a lazy humour which ſowes a pillow, to euery elbow, and is allwayes leaning homewards, that is, not to ſeek God and his greater glory, but it ſelfe, hating to take paynes and vſe diligence which is calld the mother
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50961:153"/> of good ſucceſs, a good iſſue ſeldom fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diligent. And humility is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch, nor indeed can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſynce the care and ſollicitude of the humble man is not bent vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, whome he deems vnworthy of any good, but on God, whoſe benepla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum is his ſole ioy, and to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good ſeruant his onely happynes. Pride on the contrary allwayes ſeeks it ſelfe, as prizing nothing but it ſelfe, it being a meer lump of ſelf loue; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds towards God as did that man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iupiter, who, giuing him halfe of all he had, eat the kernells of his nutts, and gaue him the shells. As humility emtyes vs of our ſelues ſo doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish vs with God and his graces: for when we putt off our ſelues we putt on Alm. God, and where the Creature cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be, there ſucceeds the Creatour by a ſequele morally neceſſary in the order of grace; as in that of nature, the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50961:154"/> ayre connaturally ſucceeds the ſubſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another body to hinder a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity. For God who is euery where by his immenſity has his propper manſion houſe, ſayth S. Auſtin, in the hart of the humble: but then he will haue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate beſydes himſelfe, he will not share Lodgings with any one, no not euen with the Land Lord himſelfe.</p>
               <p>I make this short Elogium of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to giue the leſs acquainted Reader a little knowledg of its worth: it was one of the gloryes of our Saint rendring him as acceptable to men as gratefull to God, and it is expreſsly noted in his life, that it gott him the loue of all. And no wonder; for the humble man incurrs no body's diſpleaſure, ſynce he trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neyther on theyr profitt nor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt: he contents himſelfe with what he is, and deeming himſelfe a meer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he reſts in that, and conſequently is beneath enuy: wher as the proud ſelf

All his Comportment was ſeaſond with this ingredient and carryd a ſtrong rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of it in his words, his actions, and behauiour, ſo that it was a vertue, as it ought, tranſcendentall through all.

There is great difference betwixt ſimplicity and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenes as the world takes it, which is ſo
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50961:155"/> ignorant of this vertue, that it cannot diſtinguish betwixt in and folly; wher as it doth not exclude prudence but craft and duplicity. Prudence is its indiuduall Companion, and therfore our B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour wishd his Apoſtles to ioyne the prudence of the Serpent with the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the doue: and how eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prudent our Saint was shall be shewd in the laſt Chapter. This humble ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity made him ſo obſequious to all juſt Commands; for what teaches obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience but tractability, and tractability but humility, the onely diſpoſition to ſubjection and ſubordination, as pride on the contrary is its opponent. We haue shewd already in the 13 Chapter, what a loue and reſpect he had for the poore, how he calld them his breethren, heard theyr Confeſſions before the Rich, made his table ſo open and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them that it entertaynd ſomtimes 30. ſomtimes 40. 50. yea a 100. togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50961:155"/> who, as he was as poore of ſpiritt as the moſt, ſo he lou'd like byrds of a feather to ſort with them: and all this was a reſult of his humility which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally branches into charity, ſeeking others more then it ſelfe. From this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was ſourc'd his ſingular contempt both of himſelfe and all that is ſpecious in poynt of employment or preferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: hence he reioyced ſo much at his depoſing the Office of Lord Chancellour, as much, to witt, as others at its attaynment; and was the cauſe that his promotion to the Bishoprick of Hereford coſt him ſo many teares, deſyrous rather to lye hidd vnder a bushell then be ſett in the Candleſtick of the Church. Hence he was euer ready to pardon any delinquent vpon poynt of due ſubmiſſion and pardon demanded; and many times though the fault were theyrs, he would preuent them by way
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50961:156"/> of example ſeeking friendship when they had broken it: but to the ſtubborn and incorrigible he was not eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concild. This vertue taught him alſo patience, which is ſoon loſt admidſt the Croſſes of this world if it be not ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by humility which fitts our shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for euery burden, and perſwades vs we beare no more then our due: whence it was that without repining he readily receiu'd all the perſonall affronts aboue mentiond in the 14. Chapter, without ſo much as offering at a Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euen in word.</p>
               <p>To his humility we may ioyne his Mortification and theſe two ſuite well togeather, and lend a mutuall hand to each other. For it is the humble man that is mortifyd, and the mortifyd hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; humility by ſelf contempt making way for mortification, and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aduancing humility. No man that is a ſelf louer will ſett vpon mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50961:156"/> vnles it be to deſtroy ſelfe loue, and who aymes at that beſydes the humble ſelfe denyer. The aduantages of this vertue in order to ſanctity, as it makes one truly maſter of himſelfe and all his paſſions, appetites, inclinations, &amp;c. are very great: for it is this vnruly and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous populace which giues vs all our diſturbances and conflicts betwixt the ſpiritt and the flesh, while theſe ſeruants will needs be maſters, and domineer ouer and againſt reaſon, putting all into a combuſtion.

Our B. Saint in his light and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50961:157"/> found all this true, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolu'd to keep a ſtrict hand and watchfull eye ouer them and all theyr motions, ready to ſuppreſs any inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in this kind. And by internall mortification, which is much the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, he preſeru'd his mind in ſuch a peacefull calme that one could ſcarſe diſcouer any commotion to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in ſo much that he might ſeem to liue in a Region aboue flesh and blood, where neyther winds nor tempeſts haue acceſs. And this is a thing fecible enough to the Seruant of God, if he make it his buſynes and take it to hart, grace willingly ſeconding ſuch endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours; and our Saint profited ſo much in this Kind, that, conſidering the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall tenour of his Conuerſation, one might ſay he eyther neuer had paſſions, which is impoſſible in ſuch a liuelynes of nature, or elſe kept them in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſubjection to reaſon and vertue,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50961:157"/> which is no more then truth.</p>
               <p>To this interiour Mortification he ioynd exteriour, as much facilitating the former, and rendring the flesh due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubordinate to the Spiritt; a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thoſe who ayme at a perfect conqueſt ouer them ſelues; and this he practiſd in a triple kind. Firſt by hayr cloath and other auſterityes to which he accuſtomd himſelfe many yeares, and euen at his death, not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the incident ſufferances of ſo long a journey, he was found with a hayr shyrt next his body and that of the rougher ſize. 2. by watching and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of ſleep euen neceſſary, ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe to a very short pittance, which was much felt by thoſe about him as cutting theyrs too short alſo: yett he made this a dayly cuſtome, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the remnant of the night in prayer and reading of H. Scripture, or other ſuch like pious exerciſes. 3. by a

Experience teaches too truly what an enemy gluttony and fullfeeding is to deuotion; how it indiſpoſes the mind while it ouercharges the body, and makes it think more on the fleshpotts of Aegypt then the manna of Angells. A refection is neceſſary for the recruit of our decaying forces; a repletion, which rather oppreſſes then refreshes, neuer: he muſt content himſelfe with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, and euen retrench them a little, who will auoyd ſuperfluityes; this was the prayer of the Wiſeman and muſt be <note place="margin">

               <p>S. THOMAS knew well all the aduantages of a ſober abſtinence, and therfore his dyett was ſo ſpare, that his familiars did wonder how it could giue
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50961:158"/> a competent ſuſtenance to maintaine life, and this vſually. And thus much Bishopp Richard depoſd in his Proceſs vpon oath, aſſeuering with all that his abſtinence was ſuch, that one might truly ſay his whole life was a continuall faſt. He made but one meale the day, and that with theſe short Commons, not for want of an appetite but to curb and mortify it; for being askd that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by the ſayd his ſucceſſour who then ſate next him, he confeſs'd inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously that his ſtomack ſeru'd him for much more, and taking a good piece of a loafe in his hand, ſayd, he could eat all that and with guſt. To this rigour of quantity he added another of quality: if he taſted of any curious or coſtly dish that was all, then made it be carryd ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſick or poore: his ordinary fare was of the homelyer ſort, ſuch as would ſatisfy nature not pleaſe the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, and his drink ſuitable, to witt, ſmall
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50961:159"/> beare. He ſeldome drunk wine vnles in a very ſmall quantity, or much temperd with water; he neuer willingly drunk betwixt meales, and when the quality of the perſons was ſuch that it requird ſuch a ciuility from him, he vſd pretty ſleights and artifices to euade it, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to drink when he ſcarſe touchd the Cupp. In his younger dayes and better health he was wont to faſt good Friday and all the Eues of our B. Lady with bread and water, but afterwards when his ſtock of ſtrenght would not beare that rigour, by the preſcript of his Phyſitian he was for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bid that, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to take a little broth. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this his temperance a pretty paſſage is related by the aforeſayd Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop Richard who then was preſent: A Kinsman of our Saint and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for 20. yeares and vppwards, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam of Albenack ſitting once at table with him, when all had done and it was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50961:159"/> taking away S. THOMAS eſpy'd him ſtill eating ſome bread; with which a little ſurprizd, he ſayd merrily to him; Old man, what art thou doing? I am eating, quoth he; and why now? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyd the Saint. Becauſe, ſayd the other, I find an appetite. What, ſayd S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS, and are you wont to eat as long as you find an appetite? yes, I profeſs, ſayd William, and all do ſo that I know. All do ſo? ſayd the Saint in a chiding tone, Marry God forbid: I can aſſure you in very truth that for 30. yeares till this day I haue not riſe from table with a leſs appetite then when I ſate downe. But this latter part he wiſperd in his eare forbidding him to ſpeak of it while he liu'd: and another ſtory much to the ſame purpoſe ſtands vpon authentique record, and both are a great teſtimoniall of his abſtemiouſnes and ſobriety.</p>

This Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſcharge is the work of our whole life, and conſequently of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt concerne, implying both parts of Chriſtian duty, to decline from euill and doe good, and doe good not how euer but after a good manner and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems ſuch a Majeſty: for God loues not ſlubberd ſeruices, but wil haue
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50961:160"/> them done as well with the hart as hand and tongue, or elſe they'l find a cold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. By a due complyance in this Kind we shew our loue to him, and this complyance in our Spirituall functions is calld Deuotion which is eſteemd grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſs as our performance is more feruorous or remiſs. Deuotion is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of loue, and an iſſue of diuine grace, which, if not ſourc'd from theſe two is not eſteemd genuine and currant, but to want of its graines of weight; and this may be counterfeyted as well as other vertues.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of his deuotion, or his ſpirituall exerciſes relating immediately to Alm. God were chiefly Prayer, the H. Sacrifice of Maſſe, his Canonicall Houres or diuine Office; and in the diſcharge of theſe, he was not onely, ſayth the Record, deuout but moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout, performing them with a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found attention and Reuerence. Prayer
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50961:161"/> is calld an Incenſe, and this inconſe he was, I may ſay, continually offering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the aduiſe of S. Paule, <q>ſine <note place="margin">

Baſil, is a good prayer, but alſo by a more neer, interiour and familiar Conuerſation with Alm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God by the powers of our ſoule, employing them not onely in a Conſideration of his attributes but an vnion of will. And what could a pious hart nurſd vpp in its baptiſmall grace, and conſequently the throne and Aultar of the H. Ghoſt, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to ſo diuine a gueſt beſydes pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and prayſes? the former to begg new bleſſings, the latter in thanks giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for them receiu'd. To attend the more freely to this, was the chiefe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he cutt his ſleep ſo short and riſe by night that he might watch and pray, and offer early a morning oblation to God and his Saints in an odour of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50961:161"/> ſweetneſs, killing, as the Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did, in the feruor of his prayer all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 8.</note> the ſinners of the earth. He knew that in a ſpirituall life no great matter could be atchieu'd or aduance made without this; and therfore he made it his dayly bread, and was much more frequently feeding his ſoule with it then his body with Corporall, deeming it the life which was to animate all his actions. We treated in the 12. Chapter of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrement and vnion with God, and this vnion was chiefly effected by Prayer, and intimates a frequent and conſtant practiſe of the ſame euen to an intimate familiarity, whoſe reſult it is.</p>
               <p>Euen before he was Bishop he was particularly noted for his ſingular Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Deuotion in reciting Diuine office, which argues a true feeling of Spiritt and the preſence of Alm. God: in which his exteriour Compoſure of body and attention of mind was ſuch,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50961:162"/> that it was of great edification to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders. Thus he begunn, thus he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerd vntill the end fullfilling exactly what our H. Mother the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of vs for a due diſcharge of that great function, and it were to be wishd all thoſe to whome this obligation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, were imitatours of the ſame. He was moſt exact in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and performance of Eccleſiaſticall Ceremonyes, ſo mixing piety with a Majeſtick grauity, that both the one and other begott a Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiall eſteem towards thoſe Sacred Rytes in them that were preſent. But aboue all he was moſt ſingularly deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the H. Sacrifice of Maſſe; heer his deuotion ſeemd to triumph and he at the Aultar to be in his Center, ſo full was his hart fraught with pious affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with ſuch a ſpiritt of humility and Contrition did he approach it, ſuch an ample teſtimony heeroff did he giue by
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50961:162"/> his abundance of teares, that one would haue thought he had rather, ſayth the Record, actually be held the bloody Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it ſelfe, and his Lord and Sauiour therin immolated, then an vnbloody and Myſticall repreſentation of the ſame; an argument both of his liuely fayth and ardent charity. To indulge the more to theſe pious affections he gaue heer ample ſcope to his deuotion much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ordinary ſtint of halfe an houre, letting his ſoule feed at leaſure on theſe ſweet Myſteryes; and Alm. God did ſo concurr, that he was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alienated from his ſenſes and as it were in a rapture, ſo that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſeruer (who depoſd this vpon oath) to cough and make a noyſe to bring him to himſelfe and make an end of his Maſs: and this, ſayth the ſame, happend frequently while he liu'd at Rouen, from the feaſt of S. Peter ad Vincula till the feaſt
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50961:163"/> of S. Michael next enſuing.</p>
               <p>To shew how acceptable this his piety in the H. Sacrifice and other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deuoyrs was to Alm. God, it pleaſd his diuine Majeſty to grace him particularly at the ſame with a fauour which all that were preſent attributed to Miracle, and as ſuch it was approu'd by the Lords Commiſſioners and thoſe that beheld it. On the feaſt of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt or Whitſunday he was inuited by Edmund Earle of Cornwall, a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of his Sanctity, to Celebrate the feaſt and ſay Maſs at his Caſtle of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, and it happend in the ſecond or third yeare of his Pontificate. While he was preparing and diſpoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe therto by ſinging the Hymne „Veni Creator Spiritus; vpon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of the firſt verſe, a flock of byrds in the ſight and hearing of all, with Muſicall notes and beating theyr wings againſt the Chappell windowes
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50961:163"/> ſeemd to applaud the Saint while he ſung, and he hauing ended they retyrd while the Quire proſecuted what he had enton'd till the end of the ſtrophe. But he entoning the firſt verſe of the ſecond they returnd againe, and while he ſung, both with voyce and wing they accompanyd him and applauded as before; and ſoe ſtrophe after ſtrophe till the hymne was ended. This ſeemd a great Nouelty to the ſayd Earle and all that beheld it which were many; and to ſatisfy themſelues the better, they went out of the Chappell abroad, and had a full ſight of them judging them to be about 40. and beheld them Coming and going as before, nor could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prett ſuch an vnuſuall thing neuer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeru'd before nor after, otherwiſe, then as orderd by God to wittnes the ſanctity of our Saint and the acceptablenes of the great work he was about. Then it was that the Earle in the hearing of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50961:164"/> all, Bishop Richard then Chancellour of Hereford being preſent, made that expreſſion cited in the end of the 18. Chapter of his ſingular Confidence in the prayers and patronage of S. THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS, no leſs then in thoſe of our great Apoſtle S. Auſtin.</p>
               <p>The liuely fayth and high eſteem he had of the dignity of this diuine Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it made him recollect all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers and attention for its better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, ſo it made him waue all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne reſpects when he was about it, not admitting any interruption whatſoeuer, not euen from the King himſelfe, though otherwiſe moſt obſeruant and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to his Commands. It happend once that while he was ready to veſt, a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinger came in all haſt from the King to call him to Councell without delay vpon matters of great importance, (and it was his office to attend he being of the Priuy Councell:) What muſt he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50961:164"/> doe? after a short pauſe he calls the Meſſinger, who was a Prieſt, wishing him to tell his Majeſty, if he pleaſd, in theſe tearmes; That he was now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagd in the ſeruice of one greater then himſelfe, who requird his preſent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but when I haue, ſayd he, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargd my duty to him I will not fayle to wayt on his Majeſty. After all done and his deuotions ended he repayrd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Court then keept at the Pallace at Weſtminſter; and receiuing a gentle rebuke for his delay, the matter was propoſd and diſcus'd: in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wheroff he deliuerd his aduiſe ſo pertinently, and ſuggeſted beyond the reſt ſuch expedients ſo patt and fecible, that all without reply embracd them as ſent from heauen. And the King ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyd heer with, is ſayd to haue ſpoken to him in theſe words: Many bleſſings, my Lord, light vpon you, and euer prayſd and magnifyd be that higheſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50961:165"/> maſter whome you ſerue, and long may you ſerue both him and vs. So true it is that if we ſeek in the firſt place the Kingdome of heauen and its juſtice, not fayling of our duty in that, all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condaryes will be caſt into the bargaine.</p>
               <p>I will conclude the loue he shewd to God by the religious performance of theſe his Spirituall obligations, with the deuotion he carry'd to his Saints, and chiefly to the Queen of Saints the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mother. The Prouerb ſayth, loue me and loue my friend; and God ſayth, loue me and loue my Saints, my deareſt friends; and deſeruedly: for how can they be ſayd to loue him who loue not thoſe that are one with him? In his loue to our B. Lady I will comprize all the reſt, and although this were notedly great, that is, ſo great, that he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliquely noted for it, yett we haue not much left vpon Record wherby to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate and amplify it. This not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50961:165"/> if we may meaſure the Lion by his Clawe, and gueſs at Hercules by his foot, we haue ſufficient hynts or grounds both to informe and inflame vs to his imitation in this particular. I haue shewd aboue out of authentique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that in his younger dayes he was wont to faſt the Vigills of her feaſts with bread and water, which cuſtome he continu'd till want of health diſabled him therto: and what greater expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a tender deuotion could he exhibite? The expreſsion is as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary as is the faſt, and the faſt ſpeakes as much deuotion as a faſt can doe, and ranks it with the tendereſt. He chuſe her Natiuity, as I noted aboue, for his Epiſcopall Conſecration, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſacred Character vnder her patronage; and diuers apparitions of her with him after death in a ioynt Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of both to the cure of many, shew how deare he was to her during life.
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50961:166"/> And I find that abroad he carry'd the Common eſteem of one ſingularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to her, and was poynted at as her particular client; and this perſwaſion wrought ſo farr with ſome, that they vſd it for motiue of mediation to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne what they deſyrd, beſeeching him for the loue and deuotion he bore her to grant theyr requeſt. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is recounted of one who before had bin of his houshold, and falling into a great fitt of ſicknes for ten weeks ſpace, 3. wheroff he paſsd ſleeples, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelfe to the Saint, he earneſtly beſought him for the loue he bore to the Mother of God, that he would obtaine for him the benifitt of ſleeping. This ſayd, he fell into a ſlumber, and in it thought he ſaw two men bring into his Chamber a very fine bed, in which being layd by them he ſleept ſoundly and quiettly till the morning; when being awakd and miſſing the bed,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50961:166"/> though he was more then a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd that it should be carryd away, yett neuer the leſs he found himſelfe quite Cur'd of his infirmity, and vpon the ſcore of the Saints deuotion to our B. Lady.</p>
               <p>As for his loue towards his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I had rather waue then mention it, as not able to treat of it in that due manner I ought and it deſerues: not but that it was mainly great in it ſelfe, but time and records haue bin ſo injurious as not to conuey the particulars to our knowledg; and in theſe things we muſt not goe by gueſs but certaine relation. Who can rationally doubt but that he who was a flaming furnace of loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, was enkindled with the ſame towards his Neighbour for loue of God? Or he that playd the good Shea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard for 7. yeares to geather in feeding his flock, had not a tender loue for the ſame flock, without which he had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50961:167"/> prou'd himſelfe rather a Mercenary hyreling then good Sheapard? Or if he were ſo zealously couragious for the maintenance and Recouery of his Church Lands and Libertyes, would he not be much more ſollicitous for her childrens ſoules and ſaluation? If he took her dead Concerns ſo much to hart, how much more would he her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; if he were ſo charitably charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after death in the cure of theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, how much more while he hu'd in curing theyr ſoules? We know that he was aſſiduous in preaching and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in reconciling enmityes, in hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debates, in adminiſtring juſtice, in promoting piety, in depreſſing vice, in redreſſing abuſes, in adminiſtring the Sacraments, &amp;c. but what's all this to his boundles zeale, which not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſelfe with obligatoryes would branch into ſupererogatoryes: and none of theſe latter are come to our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50961:167"/> knowledg beſydes what is already ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyd. I cannot ſatisfy my ſelfe as to what I would and ought to ſay on this poynt, and therfore I paſs to the next.</p>

               <p>This purity is that cleanes of hart to which our B. Sauiour affixd a beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in its beames our B.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50961:169"/> nor dwell in a body ſubject to Sinn.</p>
               <p>To this due preſeruation of the hart and maintenance of purity, there muſt be a joynt Concurrence of both the parts of man, body and ſoule, nor will the one be able to effect it whithout the other, it being a reſult of both. One flaw ſpoyles the worth of a iewell, one diſtorted limb or wenn a beautifull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; perfection Conſiſts in an integrity of the parts and whole: and this was the care and ſollicitude of our Saint to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byne both his in this reſpect into a Common intereſt; nor did he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it by fitts and ſpurts, but was the conſtant practiſe of his life, and who euer aymes at it, his ſolid reſolution muſt be like that of the Ermin, <q>Malo mori quam faedari </q> rather dye then ſuffer a blemmish. To effect this was the grand work of our B. Saint, as it is of all thoſe who intend to ſerue God in ſyncerity and purity: and to Compaſs
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50961:169"/> it the better he keept a ſtrict eye vpon both and theyr proceedings, by a due inquiry into them, and ſett for that end watch and ward vpon all the auenues which lead therto, ſecuring himſelfe thus againſt all ſurprizes, by a due intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of all that paſd, admitting the good rejecting the bad. By this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he enioyd a perfect peace both at home and abroad, nor in his interiour did he find eyther mutiny or inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and whoeuer will imitate this his mannagement of ſuch affayres shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the ſame. By this wary watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes, and the aſſiſtance of a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Directour in his beginnings or younger dayes, he preſeru'd himſelfe ſo vnderild both in body and ſoule, the grace of Alm. God Cooperating, that he deſeru'd from the ſame his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour in his now declining age that publique Elogium of his integrity which I mentiond in the 10. Chapter: which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50961:170"/> by aduancing from vertue to vertue he was ſtill Conſummating euen till death.</p>
               <p>This was one reaſon why he treated his crazy body ſo ſeuerely both by abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and other chaſtiſements; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well that to haue it a dutifull ſeruant it muſt be keept vnder and at task, leaſt through idlenes getting head it become vnruly and play the wanton, debauching the ſoule to its licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to which our corrupt nature too much inclines it. This flesh of ours is the worſt naturd creature vpon earth, a meer diuell to our, and its owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; it cares for no body but it ſelfe, and thats the propperty of ſelf loue, neuer regarding what woe it work the ſoule ſo it can Compaſs its deſyres and pleaſe its appetites: it is little concernd eyther for heauen or hell, creditt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditt, friend or foe; and what doe we in pampering ſuch a one, but make
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50961:170"/> much of a churlish curr which will one day doe his beſt to pull out our throat, that is, vndoe vs: the way to caſt out this Diuell is that which our Sauiour preſcribes, „in jejunio &amp; oratione„ <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 17. 20.</note> in faſting and prayer. He added to this by way of preuention a shunning of conuerſation with woemen (occaſion they ſay makes a thiefe, and he that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pitch shall be defil'd by it) euen his owne Siſters, as much as could ſtand with Common ciuility; not permitting them to lodge aboue one night in his pallace, and then his cuſtome was to leaue it himſelfe, and diuert to ſome of his maunour houſes. He had a horrour of all ſpeeches glauncing at leuity, nor durſt any in his preſence ſcatter ſuch ſmutty jeaſts, much leſs vtter broad rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldry without the penalty of a ſound check: a language much vnbeſeeming Chriſtian Conuerſation, as made vpp onely of the dreggs of witt, fitt onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50961:171"/> for the mouth of a bargman, though not a little in vogue among many world lings. The loue of this vertue made him conceiue a perfect hatred and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the contrary vice, and as both the impious and his impiety is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God, ſo had he not onely a loathing of the latter, but alſo an auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the former and thoſe he knew to be giuen to the ſame, nor could he affect them further then Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity commanded, though otherwiſe his neereſt allyes. This he made euident by his Carriage towards a nephew of his one for whome he had a great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſo long as he did well, maintaining him in the Uniuerſity, making him his Confident, and would certainly haue done very much for him. But vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he was become looſe of behauiour and not ſo chaſt in his wayes, he totally withdrew his affection, and though much preſsd to take him along
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50961:171"/> in his journey to Rome, no perſwaſion could preuaile; on which ſubject he expreſsd himſelfe to this effect. Theſe young men, ſayd he, are not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes ſo bashfull and modeſt as heerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: for when I was ſuch a one, if a handſome woman had lookd me in the face, I should preſently haue bin putt to the blush, turnd my eyes from her, (they are words of the Record) or pulld my hatt ouer them, that eyther I should not haue ſeen her or shee mee; but now things goe farr otherwiſe: nor could he euer be induc'd to receiue him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour or familiarity. This vertue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall purity was ſo conſpicuous in him that the Prayer vſd in the office of his feaſt petitions by it graces from God, and that by its meritts we may deſerue to be aſſociated to the quires of Angells; and the firſt leſſon of the ſame Office calls him Angelicus homo, an Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call man.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:50961:172"/>
               <p> And the loue and eſteem he had for this vertue was not onely verball or from the teeth outwards, but he made good in deed what he profeſſd in word: and Alm. God was pleaſd to permitt <note place="margin">

While he liu'd at Paris, he like another chaſt Joſeph was aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſame as dangerously as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently; and he like him forc'd to flye and leaue his cloak behind him, nor can that flight by deemd diſgracefull when by it we gett the victory. He gott it, and in this was more happy then Joſeph that he wonn not onely the Combatt but alſo the Tempter into the bargaine, reclayming her to a chaſt life from her impudent lubricity, and ſo deſeru'd a double reward. Such a chaſt body was fitt to be the conſort of ſo pure a ſoule to make vpp an Angelicall Compound: and its but meet that ſuch a jewell of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50961:172"/> should be keept in a ſuitable Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nett that both parts might beare propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mutually correſpond. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to trayne vpp his body to immortality, and labour to leaue it ſuch in life and death as he deſyres to find it in the Reſurrection; ſuch that it may be acknowledgd and ownd for a Member of Chtiſt as indeed it is, and what a shame then is it, as the Apoſtle argues, to make it the member of a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lott. Our B. Saint vnderſtood this right well both as to proportion, decency, and other aduantages which thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cru'd, and therfore he made it allwayes his buſynes to procure and maintaine a good Correſpondence betwixt both.</p>
               <p>Now he that was ſo induſtrious in the Cultiuating and preſeruation of his body what would he be for his ſoule and Conſcience? the other's but the ſeruant, this the Miſtreſs; that but the Shell, this the Pearle; and he knew
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50961:173"/> very well how to giue euery one its due. All he was to doe in this kind was to keep it to Chriſtian duty according to his ſtate, to cultiuate it in piety and the ſeruice of God ſowing in it the ſeeds of all vertues; and how he did this euen in his youth, and in what a nice and delicate temper he keept it, maybe knowne by what we related in the end of the 5. Chapter of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propp taken out of anothers vineyard, and the 7. yeares pennance he did for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather how Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically pure that delicate ſoule was which checkd ſo feelingly at ſo ſmall a matter, and how farr it was from har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring any great offence which deemd the leaſt to be ſo great. Nor yett was it one of thoſe which flea a gnatt and ſwallow a Camell according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our B. Sauiour, or ſtumbles at a ſtraw and leaps ouer a block; but
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50961:173"/> pure illuminated ſoules in theyr quick-ſightednes can eſpye a blemmiſh where a dimm eye of a groſſer Complexion makes no diſcouery at all. This was the Conſtitution of his mind and tenour of proceeding when he was now in the flower of his youth, and nature proneſt to lubricity, where nothing but the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace of God in an eminent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could work ſuch effects ſo oppoſite to nature and aboue it. And as he went allwayes aduancing to Sanctity euen till death, ſo did he alſo in purity, ſanctity, as S. Anſelme defines out of S. Denys, being a moſt perfect and vnſpotted pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity free and entyre from all blemmish, and to what a pitch of eminency muſt he needs arriue! I shall conclude all in this, that he liu'd and dy'd a pure Virgin both in body and mind.</p>

               <head>XXV. and laſt CHAPTER. Of his Juſtice and Prudence.</head>
               <p>BOth theſe are Cardinall Vertues, and when I haue shewd with what a rich ſtock our Saint traded in them, I shall haue made him Conſpicuous in in all fower. As for his temperance and fortitude I haue already giuen a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them; the former while I treated of his abſtinence, the latter of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and magnanimity in defence of his Church. As to what we treat of at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he had great practiſe of the former, to witt Iuſtice, in both his Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and diſchargd his truſt with ſuch integrity that all partyes concernd were abundantly ſatisfyd. And he took the true way to doe it; for he ſought it, not himſelfe; and made its advance his end, not his owne, nor the enrichment of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50961:174"/> his eſtate: while others peruersly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert true order by taking the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe. The ordering of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much vpon the well or ill orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theyr owne Conſcience, which muſt be the beame of the ballance, and to be right, ſtand allwayes perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, inclining neyther to one ſyde or other but as the ſcales ſway it, in the one wheroff muſt be juſtice, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing controuerted; to the end an eeuen and vnpartiall hand may be keept. It were much to be wishd that all diſtributers of juſtice did this; more indeed to be wishd then hopd for, while ſo many make a trade of ſelling what they ought to giue, and gratis; theyr honeſty becoming venall to auarice, and them ſelues imitatours of Iudas, who as he ſold his Maſter ſo they theyr Miſtreſs, for what are all in office but her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and Miniſters; that which Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuated the other Captiuates them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50961:175"/> theyr ſenſe, and miſleads them from the paths of equity. This proceeds from being not ſo well principled in poynt of Conſcience and juſtice, which goe allwayes hand in hand togeather, and are attended by vprightnes and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity: and thus our B. Saint walkd in them with the Common approbation of all, guided not by the dictamens of this world but Diuine Wiſdome, by whoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. 15,</note> direction all both Lawgiuers and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of juſtice decree and execute juſt things.</p>
               <p>Thus he purchaſd that vogue of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity which euery where accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd his proceedings, growing vpp with him euen from his youth, and ſo habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually rooted and relucent in all his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that it is noted as the prime Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue why he was choſen firſt to the Chancelorship of the Vniuerſity and then of the whole Kingdome. And Certainly ſuch an integrity of juſtice
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50961:175"/> is an excellent Cemmendatory to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, as giuing great aduantages to a full diſcharge of truſt, and ſtrange it is that men do not take this way to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it when they ſeek ſo greedily after it. If naturall abilityes be ſo much regarded, how much more in all reaſon ought ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall? if witt, how much more vertue? Witt without vertue and grace degenerates for the moſt part into Craft, and turnes publique juſtice into priuate ends and ſelfſeeking. Euen thoſe that are not vertuous are great admirers of it in others, as being praiſe worthy in a very enemy: and ſynce no body but loues to haue theyr things well done, and nothing Contributes more then it to theyr welldoing; as they willingly Couet the former ſo they are forward in preferring the latter. Beſydes that Honours and Offices are Commonly at the diſpoſall of the honorable, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honour and integrity; and who
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50961:176"/> ſtand more cleare in theyr eye, or are deem'd better deſeruing, or laſtly by whome are they like to haue more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditt and ſatisfaction then by the vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and vertuous? This vertue is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpecifyd in the ancient Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Office, where he is ſayd to haue bin <q>in juſtis operibus ſemper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votus allwayes much deuoted to the practiſe of juſtice:</q> and elswhere in the ſame, <q>Iura Eccleſiae ſuae viriliter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendebat indutus juſtitia ut Lorica</q> he couragiously defended the Rights of his Church armd with juſtice as with a breaſt plate. And this repute purchaſd him ſuch a name that it ſett him as it were out of the reach of temptation; and he in reality ſo abhorrd any thing in its adminiſtration which lookd like a bribe, that he was a frayd euen of its shadow. It is particularly recounted that certaine Religious men, who had a ſuite depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at Law, applyd themſelues to him
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50961:176"/> for his fauour and furtherance in the diſpatch of the ſame, and therto preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with a jewell of value; which he rejected not without indignation, asking them whether they thought him to be wonn with guifts. Theyr inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion queſtionles was good, and aymd at no more then a reedeming of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes of the Law, not a buying of it, which they knew could not be ſold: but a Iudge muſt auoyd euen ſuſpicions in this kind, chuſing rather to ſitt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawfull gaine then haue it with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of dishoneſty; better is a good name, ſayth the Wiſeman, then great <note place="margin">

One in that office who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes himſelfe ſo religiously, where ſo many eyes are vpon him, as not to be taxd by any, it is a great euidence that he diſcharges his truſt vprightly. In the Vniuerſity he had the ſame Character, and that was a ſtepp to the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion where he gaue as ample ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50961:177"/> by a juſt performance of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in promoting learning, aduancing vertue, exacting Diſcipline, redreſſing abuſes, punishing offenders, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Marc.</hi> 7. 37.</note> omnia fecit</q> he did all well. It was chiefly for the eſteem they had of his juſtice and piety that he was made Chancellor of the Vniuerſity, and for theſe particularly was he prayſd publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame by Robert Arch Bishop of Canterbury, affirming that in all his iudiciall Acts relating to the Students he was neyther ſwayd with fauour of feare, but regulated himſelfe meerly by juſtice and the meritts of the cauſe.</p>
               <p>In adminiſtring juſtice, what he did by himſelfe, the dictates of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inuſolably keept, would not lett him ſwarue from a vertuous reaſon; and in what he was forcd to entruſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50961:177"/> others with all, he burdend theyr Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences (the onely tye to him that ownes one) to a faythfull diſcharge, as they would anſwere it at Gods tribunal. When complaynts were made againſt his Bayliffs or other Officers, he took the matter to his owne ſcanning, and if he found them faulty he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with punishing them, but reuok<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d and annulld what they had vnjuſtly done, cauſing ſatisfaction to be made to the injurd partyes. When euer he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a concerne of juſtice in any cauſe he was ſo reſolute for its vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and maintenance, that he wan'd all other conſiderations: whence it was that in his Law-ſuites for the Recouery of his Church Lands, mentiond aboue in the 15. Chapter, though the power of his aduerſaryes were formidable enough, and the iſſue on that reſpect doubtfull, yett he could neuer be brought to harken to any vnderhand
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50961:178"/> compoſition, though more perchance for his priuate intereſt. The Earle of Gloceſter when he preceiu'd himſelfe caſt in Law offerd round ſumms of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to lett the ſuite fall: Peter Corbett did the ſame on a like occaſion; and Roger Lord Clifford, as knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more lyable to the Law (for he in time of warr had taken the then Bishop of Hereford priſoner meerly to extort a ranſome from him) labourd to redeem his publique pennance with a 100. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (a great ſumme in thoſe dayes,) but the Saint was inflexible to all ſuch motions, reſolu'd to leaue all to the Courſe of Juſtice. In the publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he as Counſellour had in affayres, he obſeru'd that the Jewes, permitted then to liue promiſcously, were very pernicious to the State, not onely for counterfeyting falſe Coyne, but alſo by reaſon of theyr vſurarious extorſions by which they eat-out the eſtates of theyr
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50961:178"/> debters to theyr vtter vndoing. Wher vpon he preuaild with the King that ſome fitt men might be appoynted to preach to them, and if they would ſtill remayne obſtinate, that then they should quitt the Realme. They vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what was doing and 500. of them, ſayth the Record, came in a body to him, offering large ſummes of money if he would deſiſt: but they miſsd much of theyr mark, nor found him like ſome others capable of a bribe; his anſwere was, they were enemyes to God and Rebells to fayth, nor could euer gaine his good will but by becoming good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this Corallary of our Saints vertues and Narratiue of his life with that which conſummated all into perfection, his prudence: this deſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompany's juſtice and is its aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, ſynce this orders what that execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Prudence is ſtiled by the Wiſeman
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50961:179"/> the Science of Saints, a Science without which the greateſt learning is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Wiſdome folly; and it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, ſayth the Prince of Diuines, in a due Election of Mediums and ordering them to our finall End, the Compaſſing wheroff is our finall beatitude, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Conſummate Wiſdome. This is its great Act or Maſter piece, and from hence imparts its influence into the Common concerns and mannagement of all our proceedings, giuing them weight, and ſquaring them according to Chriſtian vertue. This part of Diuine Wiſdome grew vpp with our Saint from his childhood; and that it might not degenerate into Craft (a hand-mayd Iſſue that will needs like Iſmael ſtand in Competition with the Legitimate Iſaac) he ioynd ſimplicity with it to exclude all duplicity or double dealing, the onely art by which craft thriues; knowing right well the truth of that Common
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50961:179"/> ſaying, <q>Prudens ſimplicitas denſa feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas</q> Prudent ſimplicity fertil feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and what a rich Cropp is to be reapd thence! It is recorded of him that he was of an eminent prudence and had a deep inſight into all ſorts of affayres as well temporall as Spirituall: and why not? the light of grace doth neyther dazell nor ouercaſt but rather cleare vpp the ſight of our judgment, and when ſupernaturall light is added to Naturall it muſt needs perfect and improue, ſynce an inferiour can neuer ſuffer an allay by mixing with a ſuperiour, as braſs or ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with gold. Whence I conclude that the greateſt Saints are fitteſt to make the grateſt Statesmen, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are freeeſt from Corruption, and leaſt ſwayd with paſſion and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt (two great blinders of judgment) but alſo for the ſingular aduantage theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall abilityes receiue from the light and aſſiſtance of diuine grace. Whence
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50961:180"/> it is obſeruable in our Hiſtoryes that in Catholique times Learned Bishops and vertuous Prelates were employd ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily both at home and abroad in the mannagement of weightyeſt affayres: and who, I pray, more knowing then they, or ought to be of greater inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity?</p>
               <p>As a generall opinion acquird by his juſt and vpright Carriage preferrd him to the Chancellorship of the Vniuerſity, ſo his prudent demeanment in the ſame, made King Harry the 3. preferr him to that of the Kingdome. And though vpon that good Kings death at his owne earneſt requeſt he were licenc'd by his Sonn Edward to relinquish it, yett he keept him ſtill of his Priuy Councell; and how much he eſteemd his aduiſe is ſeen by what we recounted in the 23. Chapter. He that could wade through the deep affayres of two Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorships and a Bishoprick, and keep
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50961:180"/> ſtill aboue the waters of any dislike or disſatisfaction, where ſo many ſinke, muſt needs haue bin ſupported with a great prudence. The meanes he vſd for this ſupport was to haue knowing and conſcientious men about him, who vnderſtood both what in prudence was to be done and would execute it honeſtly: and when, all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces duely weighd, he found that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of prudence and Conſcience this was to be effected or that omitted, he ſtuck ſo cloſe to his principles that neyther feare nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect could moue him in the leaſt; and this we confirm'd with an example in the 8. Chapter. We muſt alſo Conſider the times in which hee bore the aforeſayd Offices moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiett and turbulent, and to keep ſure footing on ſuch ſlippery ground argues a great prudence and wiſdome: it argues that he could Maſter both
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50961:181"/> the times and himſelfe, not they him.</p>
               <p>And now hauing giuen as good á Character of this vertue in our Saint as my breuity and informations will allow, it is time to make an end: and though I haue ſayd little in regard of what might be ſayd, yett I think I ſay much to its and his Commendation, when I shew that by it he orderd both his Spirituall and temporall Concerns ſo, as to proue himſelfe a great Saint in the former, and a great Statesman in the latter. In his declining age, eſpecially after he was made Bishop, he withdrew himſelfe as much as he could from all worldly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the more to apply himſelfe to heauenly, and that was the greateſt poynt of prudence which euer he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſd, teaching him that the Kingdome of heauen was to be ſought in the firſt place and aboue all. For what will it auaile one to gaine the whole world if
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:50961:181"/> he looſe heauen and his owne ſoule, or with what exchange will he be able to redeem that loſs? What matters it if one enioy all the pleaſures of the world, all the treaſures of the world, and all its higheſt preferrments if he haue not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the end of them? that is to ſay, what matters it to enioy heer a ſeeming momentary happynes, and be moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy heerafter for all eternity? To be truly prudent is to be prudent to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo was our Saint, and who euer is not thus prudent proues himſelfe a very foole.</p>
               <p>True prudence guides to true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynes; as there is no true happynes but eternall, ſo neyther true prudence but which leads to this eternity. This is true prudence indeed, its great Act and Maſter piece; at which all our practicall prudence in this great manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement muſt leuell as at its finall ſcope, and the purchaſe of all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50961:182"/> in this lifes Commerce. As nothing leſs then eternity will doe our work, that is, make vs eternally happy, ſo muſt we acquieſce in no other, none but that being truly ſatiatiue, and all the reſt an empty shadow. The prudence of the flesh, ſayth the Apoſtle, is death, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6.</note> and operates it: the wiſdome of this world, ſayth the ſame, is folly with God; that Cannot be a guide of our <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 19.</note> proceedings. Ours muſt be refin'd aboue the world and death, the iſſue of diuine Wiſdome, and therfore is calld by it the Science of Saints, <q>Scientia <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.</note> Sanctorum prudentia.</q> This Science our B. Saint ſtudy'd all his life long, and learnd more true knowledg out of it, then he did out of all the Philoſophy of Ariſtotle, or Idaeas of Plato. He learnd to be vertuous, to keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, his duty towards God, his Neighbour, and himſelfe, to ſubdue ſenſe to reaſon, and the whole man to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50961:182"/> the Obedience of the Diuine Law. He learnd to preferr a ſolid happynes before a ſeeming one, eternity before time, the ſoule before the body, and God and his Seruice aboue all. Chriſt our B. Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 16.</note> ſends vs to the Serpent to learne this prudence; and it teaches vs a twofold: to expoſe the whole body to ſaue the head, the ſeat of life; and ſo muſt wee all our externall goods, body and all, for the preſeruation of our fayth and ſafety of our Soules. The Serpent, ſay Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, ſtopps one eare with its tayle the other it clapps cloſe to the ground, ſo to become deafe to charmes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments; and prudence bidds vs imitate this amidſt the enchantments of Sinnfull pleaſures, (according to that of the 57. Pſalme) to which our Corrupt nature inclines. Common errours lead the way, Cuſtome like a torrent carry's vs head long, and engulfs vs in a ſea of Spirituall Miſeryes. To theſe two we
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50961:183"/> may add a third; and it is, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by forcing her paſſage through a narrow Cranny ſtripps her ſelfe of her old coat and togeather of her old age and ſo becomes young. Wee by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring, as our Sauiour aduiſes, to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 13. 24.</note> enter by the narrow gate may effect the ſame, and, ſtripping our ſelues of inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate habitts, putt on a newnes of life. Let vs learne at leaſt to auoyd groſs mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes againſt prudence, if we cannot all. Euen Common prudence bidds vs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the mayne Concern when we cannot all particulars, it being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no indiſcretion to hazard ſomething to ſaue the whole. What is our main Concern but our Soule? if we looſe that we looſe all: to venture a limb to ſaue our life is a dictate of nature; and to exſpoſe both body and eſtate to ſaue our Soule is a Certain Maxime of grace. If we muſt quitt eyther a leaſe for life, or an inhereritance, it would be deemd
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50961:183"/> madnes to part with the latter to ſecure the former, this being as much in its Kind as to exchange pearles for peebles and gold for Clinquant; and is the ſame when euer Soule and body, time and eternity, heauen and this world come into Competency. To make heer a right Election is the part of prudence; and our glorious S. THOMAS both did it and teaches vs to doe it, and of all the vertuous leſſons of his whole life none then this is more important, none more prudent. God in his grace and light giue vs ſtrength to make the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolues, and execute them with an equall fidelity. Amen.</p>
